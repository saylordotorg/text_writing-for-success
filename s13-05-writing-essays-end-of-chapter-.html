            <li>On a separate sheet of paper, choose one of the examples of a proper thesis statement from this chapter (one that interests you) and form three supporting points for that statement. After you have formed your three points, write a topic sentence for each body paragraph. Make sure that your topic sentences can be backed up with examples and details.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Group activity.</strong> Choose one of the topics from <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09_s01#fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_n02">Note 9.5 "Exercise 1"</a> in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09_s01#fresh-ch09_s01">Section 9.1 "Developing a Strong, Clear Thesis Statement"</a> and form a yes-or-no question about that topic. Then, take a survey of the people in your class to find out how they feel about the subject. Using the majority vote, ask those people to write on slips of paper the reasons for their opinion. Using the data you collect, form a thesis statement based on your classmates’ perspectives on the topic and their reasons.</li>
            <li>On a separate sheet of a paper, write an introduction for an essay based on the thesis statement from the group activity using the techniques for introductory paragraphs that you learned in this chapter.</li>
            <li>Start a journal in which you record “spoken” thesis statements. Start listening closely to the opinions expressed by your teachers, classmates, friends, and family members. Ask them to provide at least three reasons for their opinion and record them in the journal. Use this as material for future essays.</li>
            <li>Open a magazine and read a lengthy article. See if you can pinpoint the thesis statement as well as the topic sentence for each paragraph and its supporting details.</li>
