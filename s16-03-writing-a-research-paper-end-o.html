            <li>In this chapter, you learned strategies for generating and narrowing a topic for a research paper. Brainstorm to create a list of five general topics of personal or professional interest to you that you would like to research. Then use freewriting and preliminary research to narrow three of these topics to manageable size for a five- to seven-page research paper. Save your list of topics in a print or electronic file and add to it periodically as you identify additional areas of interest. Use your topic list as a starting point the next time a research paper is assigned.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Working with one of the topics you just identified, use the research skills you learned in this chapter to locate three to five potentially useful print or electronic sources of information about the topic. Create a list that includes the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch12_s03_l02">
                    <li>One subject-specific periodicals database likely to include relevant articles on your topic</li>
                    <li>Two articles about your topic written for an educated general audience</li>
                    <li>At least one article about your topic written for an audience with specialized knowledge</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">In real-life and work-related contexts, people consult a wide range of different information sources every day, without always making conscious judgments about whether the source is reliable and why. Identify one media source of information you use at least once a week—for instance, a website you visit regularly, or a newspaper or magazine to which you subscribe. Write two paragraphs explaining the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch12_s03_l03">
                    <li>What topics you learn about by reading or viewing this source</li>
                    <li>Whether you consider this source reliable and why</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s03_p01">In addressing the latter point, be sure to consider details that help you evaluate the source’s credibility and reputability, as well as the presence or absence of bias.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Different professional communities develop their own standards about the writing style people in that community use when creating documents to share with others. In some cases, these standards may apply to a very broad group of professionals—for example, researchers in many different social sciences use APA style in academic writing. MLA style is commonly used in the humanities, including English classes. In other cases, style guidelines are specific to a particular company or organization. Find a document, such as a newsletter or brochure, that was produced by an organization to which you belong. (Make sure it is a document you have permission to share.) Review the document and answer the following questions:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch12_s03_l04">
                    <li>What are the purpose, intended audience, and message of this document?</li>
                    <li>How does the writing style function to fulfill the purpose, appeal to a particular audience, and convey a message? Consider elements of style, such as word choice, the use of active or passive voice, sentence length, and sentence structure. If your document includes graphics, consider their effectiveness as well.</li>
                    <li>Are there any places where the style is inconsistent?</li>
                    <li>Is the writing style of this document effective for achieving the document’s purpose? Why or why not? If it is not effective, explain why.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
