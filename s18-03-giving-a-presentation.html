    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_p01">By this time, you have already completed much of the preparation for your presentation. You have organized your ideas and planned both the textual and visual components of your presentation. Still, you may not feel quite ready to speak in front of a group.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_p02">Public speaking is stressful. In fact, some researchers have found that a large percentage of people surveyed rate public speaking as their number one fear. Most people feel at least a little bit nervous at the prospect of public speaking.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_p03">At the same time, it is an increasingly necessary skill in the workplace. A human resource manager presents company policies and benefits plans to large groups of employees. An entrepreneur presents the idea for a new business to potential investors. A nurse might chair a staff meeting to introduce new hospital procedures. A police officer might present crime-prevention tips at a community meeting. In some fields, such as training and teaching, speaking in public is a regular job requirement.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_p04">In this section, you will learn strategies for becoming a confident, effective speaker. You have already taken the major steps toward making your presentation successful, as a result of the content planning you did in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch14#fresh-ch14">Chapter 14 "Creating Presentations: Sharing Your Ideas"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch14_s01#fresh-ch14_s01">Section 14.1 "Organizing a Visual Presentation"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch14_s02#fresh-ch14_s02">Section 14.2 "Incorporating Effective Visuals into a Presentation"</a>. Now, it is time to plan and practice your delivery.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Makes a Speaker Effective?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_p01">Think about times you have been part of the audience for a speech, lecture, or other presentation. You have probably noticed how certain traits and mannerisms work to engage you and make the experience enjoyable. Effective speakers project confidence and interest in both their audience and their subject matter. They present ideas clearly and come across as relaxed but in control.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_p02">In contrast, less effective speakers may seem anxious or, worse, apathetic. They may be difficult to hear or understand, or their body language may distract from their message. They have trouble making a connection with their audience. This can happen even when the speaker knows his or her material and has prepared effective visual aids.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_p03">In both cases, two factors contribute to your overall impression of the speaker: voice and body language. The following sections discuss specific points to focus on.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Finding Your Voice</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_p01">Most people do not think much about how their voices come across in everyday conversations. Talking to other people feels natural. Unfortunately, speaking in public does not, and that can affect your voice. For instance, many people talk faster when they give presentations, because they are nervous and want to finish quickly. In addition, some traits that do not matter too much in ordinary conversation, such as a tendency to speak quietly, can be a problem when speaking to a group. Think about the characteristics discussed in the following section and how your own voice might come across.</p>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Resonance</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s01_p01">One quality of a good speaking voice is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">resonance</a><span class="glossdef">In public speaking, the strength, depth, and force of someone’s voice.</span></span>, meaning strength, depth, and force. This word is related to the word <em class="emphasis">resonate</em>. Resonant speech begins at the speaker’s vocal cords and resonates throughout the upper body. The speaker does not simply use his or her mouth to form words, but instead projects from the lungs and chest. (That is why having a cold can make it hard to speak clearly.)</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s01_p02">Some people happen to have powerful, resonant voices. But even if your voice is naturally softer or higher pitched, you can improve it with practice.</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>Take a few deep breaths before you begin rehearsing.</li>
                    <li>Hum a few times, gradually lowering the pitch so that you feel the vibration not only in your throat but also in your chest and diaphragm.</li>
                    <li>Try to be conscious of that vibration and of your breathing while you speak. You may not feel the vibration as intensely, but you should feel your speech resonate in your upper body, and you should feel as though you are breathing easily.</li>
                    <li>Keep practicing until it feels natural.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Enunciation</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Enunciation</a><span class="glossdef">How a speaker articulates words. Good speakers enunciate clearly.</span></span> refers to how clearly you articulate words while speaking. Try to pronounce words as clearly and accurately as you can, enunciating each syllable. Avoid mumbling or slurring words. As you rehearse your presentation, practice speaking a little more slowly and deliberately. Ask someone you know to give you feedback.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s03">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Volume</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s03_p01">Volume is simply how loudly or softly you speak. Shyness, nervousness, or overenthusiasm can cause people to speak too softly or too loudly, which may make the audience feel frustrated or put off. Here are some tips for managing volume effectively:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s03_l01">
                    <li>Afraid of being too loud, many people speak too quietly. As a rule, aim to use a slightly louder volume for public speaking than you use in conversation.</li>
                    <li>Consider whether you might be an exception to the rule. If you know you tend to be loud, you might be better off using your normal voice or dialing back a bit.</li>
                    <li>Think about volume in relation to content. Main points should usually be delivered with more volume and force. However, lowering your voice at crucial points can also help draw in your audience or emphasize serious content.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s04">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Pitch</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s04_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pitch</a><span class="glossdef">How high or low a speaker’s voice is.</span></span> refers to how high or low a speaker’s voice is. The overall pitch of people’s voices varies among individuals. We also naturally vary our pitch when speaking. For instance, our pitch gets higher when we ask a question and often when we express excitement. It often gets lower when we give a command or want to convey seriousness.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s04_p02">A voice that does not vary in pitch sounds monotonous, like a musician playing the same note repeatedly. Keep these tips in mind to manage pitch:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s04_l01">
                    <li>Pitch, like volume, should vary with your content. Evaluate your voice to make sure you are not speaking at the same pitch throughout your presentation.</li>
                    <li>It is fine to raise your pitch slightly at the end of a sentence when you ask a question. However, some speakers do this for every sentence, and as a result, they come across as tentative and unsure. Notice places where your pitch rises, and make sure the change is appropriate to the content.</li>
                    <li>Lower your pitch when you want to convey authority. But do not overdo it. Questions should sound different from statements and commands.</li>
                    <li>Chances are, your overall pitch falls within a typical range. However, if your voice is very high or low, consciously try to lower or raise it slightly.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s05">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Pace</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s05_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pace</a><span class="glossdef">The speed or rate at which you speak.</span></span> is the speed or rate at which you speak. Speaking too fast makes it hard for an audience to follow the presentation. The audience may become impatient.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s05_p02">Many less experienced speakers tend to talk faster when giving a presentation because they are nervous, want to get the presentation over with, or fear that they will run out of time. If you find yourself rushing during your rehearsals, try these strategies:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s05_l01">
                    <li>Take a few deep breaths before you speak. Make sure you are not forgetting to breathe during your presentation.</li>
                    <li>Identify places where a brief, strategic pause is appropriate—for instance, when transitioning from one main point to the next. Build these pauses into your presentation.</li>
                    <li>If you still find yourself rushing, you may need to edit your presentation content to ensure that you stay within the allotted time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s05_p03">If, on the other hand, your pace seems sluggish, you will need to liven things up. A slow pace may stem from uncertainty about your content. If that is the case, additional practice should help you. It also helps to break down how much time you plan to spend on each part of the presentation and then make sure you are adhering to your plan.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s05_p04">Pace affects not only your physical presentation but also the point of view; slowing down the presentation may allow your audience to further comprehend and consider your topic. Pace may also refer to the rate at which PowerPoint slides appear. If either the slide or the animation on the slide automatically appears, make sure the audience has adequate time to read the information or view the animation before the presentation continues.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s01_s06_p02">Before you begin rehearsing your presentation, think about what tone is appropriate for the content. Should you sound forceful, concerned, or matter-of-fact? Are there places in your presentation where a more humorous or more serious tone is appropriate? Think about the tone you should project, and practice setting that tone.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Power of Body Language</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p01">The nonverbal content of a presentation is just as important as the verbal delivery. A person’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">body language</a><span class="glossdef">Nonverbal cues, such as eye contact, facial expressions, posture, gestures, and movement, that convey a message to a speaker’s audience.</span></span>—eye contact, facial expressions, posture, gestures, and movement—communicates a powerful message to an audience before any words are spoken.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p02">People interpret and respond to each other’s body language instinctively. When you talk to someone, you notice whether the other person is leaning forward or hanging back, nodding in agreement or disagreement, looking at you attentively or looking away. If your listener slouches, fidgets, or stares into space, you interpret these nonverbal cues as signs of discomfort or boredom. In everyday conversations, people often communicate through body language without giving it much conscious thought. Mastering this aspect of communication is a little more challenging, however, when you are giving a presentation. As a speaker, you are onstage. It is not easy to see yourself as your audience sees you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p03">Think about times you have been part of a speaker’s audience. You have probably seen some presenters who seemed to own the room, projecting confidence and energy and easily connecting with the audience. Other presenters may have come across as nervous, gloomy, or disengaged. How did body language make a difference?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_p04">Three factors work together powerfully to convey a nonverbal message: eye contact, posture, and movement.</p>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Eye Contact and Facial Expressions</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s01_p01">“Maintain eye contact” is a common piece of public-speaking advice—so common it may sound elementary and clichéd. Why is that simple piece of advice so hard to follow?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s01_p02">Maintaining eye contact may not be as simple as it sounds. In everyday conversation, people establish eye contact but then look away from time to time, because staring into someone’s eyes continuously feels uncomfortably intense. Two or three people conversing can establish a comfortable pattern of eye contact. But how do you manage that when you are addressing a group?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s01_p03">The trick is to focus on one person at a time. Zero in on one person, make eye contact, and maintain it just long enough to establish a connection. (A few seconds will suffice.) Then move on. This way, you connect with your audience, one person at a time. As you proceed, you may find that some people hold your gaze and others look away quickly. That is fine, as long as you connect with people in different parts of the room.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s01_p04">Pay attention to your facial expressions as well. If you have thought about how you want to convey emotion during different parts of your presentation, you are probably already monitoring your facial expressions as you rehearse. Be aware that the pressure of presenting can make your expression serious or tense without your realizing it.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s01_p05">If you are speaking to a very large group, it may be difficult to make eye contact with each individual. Instead, focus on a smaller group of persons or one row of people at time. Look in their direction for a few seconds and then shift your gaze to another small group in the room.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Posture</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s02_p01">While eye contact establishes a connection with your audience, your posture establishes your confidence. Stand straight and tall with your head held high to project confidence and authority. Slouching or drooping, on the other hand, conveys timidity, uncertainty, or lack of interest in your own presentation.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s02_p02">It will not seem natural, but practice your posture in front of a mirror. Take a deep breath and let it out. Stand upright and imagine a straight line running from your shoulders to your hips to your feet. Rock back and forth slightly on the balls of your feet until your weight feels balanced. You should not be leaning forward, backward, or to either side. Let your arms and hands hang loosely at your sides, relaxed but not limp. Then lift your chin slightly and look into your own eyes. Do you feel more confident?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s02_p03">You might not just yet. In fact, you may feel overly self-conscious or downright silly. In time, however, maintaining good posture will come more naturally, and it will improve your effectiveness as a speaker.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s02_n01">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s02_p04">Nervousness affects posture. When feeling tense, people often hunch up their shoulders without realizing it. (Doing so just makes them feel even tenser and may inhibit breathing, which can affect your delivery.) As you rehearse, relax your shoulders so they are not hunched forward or pushed back unnaturally far. Stand straight but not rigid. Do not try to suck in your stomach or push out your chest unnaturally. You do not need to stand like a military officer, just a more confident version of yourself.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s03_p01">The final piece of body language that helps tie your presentation together is your use of gestures and movement. A speaker who barely moves may come across as wooden or lacking energy and emotion. Excessive movement and gestures, on the other hand, are distracting. Strive for balance.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s01_s02_s03_p02">A little movement can do a lot to help you connect with your audience and add energy to your presentation. Try stepping forward toward your audience at key moments where you really want to establish that personal connection. Consider where you might use gestures such as pointing, holding up your hand, or moving your hands for emphasis.

The right attire can also help you avoid making distracting gestures. While you talk, you do not want to be tugging on necktie tied too tight or wobbling on flimsy high-heeled shoes. Choose clothing that is appropriately professional and comfortable.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Rehearsing Your Presentation and Making Final Preparations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_p01">Practice is essential if you want your presentation to be effective. Speaking in front of a group is a complicated task because there are so many components to stay on top of—your words, your visual aids, your voice, and your body language. If you are new to public speaking, the task can feel like juggling eggs while riding a unicycle. With experience, it gets easier, but even experienced speakers benefit from practice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_p02">Take the time to rehearse your presentation more than once. Each time you go through it, pick another element to refine. For instance, once you are comfortable with the overall verbal content, work on integrating your visuals. Then focus on your vocal delivery and your body language. Multiple practice sessions will help you integrate all of these components into a smooth, effective presentation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_p03">Practice in front of another person (or a small group) at least once. Practicing with a test audience will help you grow accustomed to interacting with other people as you talk, and it will give you a chance to get feedback from someone else’s perspective. Your audience can help you identify areas to improve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_p04">Just as important as identifying areas for improvement, your audience can encourage you not to be too hard on yourself. When preparing for an oral presentation, many people are their own worst critics. They are hyperconscious of any flaws in their presentation, real or imagined. A test audience can provide honest feedback from a neutral observer who can provide support and constructive critique.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Your Environment</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s01_p01">Part of being a good presenter is managing your environment effectively. Your environment may be the space, the sound levels, and any tools or equipment you will use. Take these factors into account as you rehearse. Consider the following questions:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>Will you have enough space to move around in? Consider whether you might need to rearrange chairs or tables in the room in advance.</li>
                <li>Do you have enough space to display your visual aids? If you are using slides, where will you project the images?</li>
                <li>Will the lighting in the room need to be adjusted for your presentation? If so, where are the light switches located? How are window coverings opened or closed?</li>
                <li>Will your audience be able to hear you? Does the environment have any distracting noises, such as heating or cooling vents, outside traffic, or noisy equipment or machines? If so, how can you minimize the problem? Will you need a microphone?</li>
                <li>Do you have access to any technical equipment you need, such as a laptop computer, a projector, or a CD or DVD player? Are electrical outlets conveniently placed and functional?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s01_p02">You may not be able to control every aspect of the environment to your liking. However, by thinking ahead, you can make the best of the space you have to work in. If you have a chance to rehearse in that environment, do so.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Engaging Your Audience: Planning a Question-and-Answer Session</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s02_p01">Rehearsing your presentation will help you feel confident and in control. The most effective presenters do not simply rehearse the content they will deliver. They also think about how they will interact with their audience and respond effectively to audience input.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s02_p02">An effective way to interact is to plan a brief question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) session to follow your presentation. Set aside a few minutes of your allotted time to address audience questions. Plan ahead. Try to anticipate what questions your audience might have, so you can be prepared to answer them. You probably will not have enough time to cover everything you know about the topic in your presentation. A Q&amp;A session can give you an opportunity to fill in any gaps for your audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s02_p03">Finally, accept that interacting with your audience means going with the flow and giving up a little of your control. If someone asks a question you were not anticipating and cannot answer, simply admit you do not know and make a note to follow up.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s02_p04">Increasingly, employees need to manage a virtual environment when giving presentations in the workplace. You might need to conduct a webinar, a live presentation, meeting, workshop, or lecture delivered over the web; run an online Q&amp;A chat session; or coordinate a conference call involving multiple time zones.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s02_s02_p05">Preparation and rehearsal can help ensure that a virtual presentation goes smoothly. Complete a test run of any software you will use. Ask a coworker to assist you to ensure that both you and the audience have all the tools needed and that the tools are in working order. Make sure you have contact information for all the key meeting attendees. Finally, know whom to call if something goes wrong, and have a backup plan.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s03_p01">The tips in this chapter should help you reduce any nervousness you may feel about public speaking. Although most people are a little anxious about talking to a group, the task usually becomes less intimidating with experience and practice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s03_p02">Preparation and practice are the best defenses against public-speaking anxiety. If you have made a serious effort to prepare and rehearse, you can be confident that your efforts will pay off. If you still feel shaky, try the following strategies:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Take care of your health. In the days leading up to your presentation, make sure you get plenty of sleep and eat right. Exercise to help cope with tension. Avoid caffeine if it makes you jittery.</li>
            <li>Use relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and stretching to help you feel calm and focused on the day of your presentation.</li>
            <li>Visualize yourself giving a successful presentation. Image yourself succeeding. It will make you feel more confident.</li>
            <li>Put things into perspective. What is the worst that could happen if anything went wrong? Many people have given less-than-perfect presentations and lived to tell about it! Of course, you should make your best effort, but if something does go wrong, you can use it as a learning experience.</li>
            <li>Understand that you may not be able to overcome your nervousness completely. Feeling a little anxious can help you stay alert and focused. If you do not feel confident, try to “fake it until you make it.”</li>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s03_p03">To practice overcoming public-speaking anxiety, ask a family member, coworker, or peer to view a rehearsal of the presentation. Schedule the rehearsal at a time that works for you, and plan to get plenty of rest the night before. After the presentation, answer the following questions.</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch14_s03_s03_l02">
                <li>When did you feel most nervous during the presentation? Make a note on your outline of the most nervous moments. Next to this note, add one strategy that may ease your anxiety. For example, you could add a reminder to relax, such as, “Take a deep breath here!” or a few words of encouragement, such as, “You are doing a great job!”</li>
                <li>Ask your rehearsal audience for feedback on which moments of the presentation seemed most nerve wrecking for you. What nonverbal or verbal clues indicated to your audience that you were nervous? Which were most distracting to the audience? Make a note of these clues and practice the presentation again; be aware of how you show your anxiety and try to lessen these distractions.</li>
