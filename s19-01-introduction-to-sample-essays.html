            <li>Identify the role of reading in the writing process.</li>
            <li>Read examples of the rhetorical modes.</li>
        </ol>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch15_s01_p01">This chapter contains quality samples of the rhetorical modes described in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch10#fresh-ch10">Chapter 10 "Rhetorical Modes"</a>. While you read these essays, remember the purpose of the writing and pay attention to the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch15_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Thesis statement.</strong> What is the author’s main point of the essay? Identify the sentence and see how well it is supported throughout the essay.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Topic sentence.</strong> How well does each topic sentence support the thesis, and how well does it describe the main idea of the following paragraph?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Supporting evidence</strong>. Identify the evidence that the author uses to support the essay’s main ideas, and gauge their credibility.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch15_s01_p02">The best way to become a better writer is to become a closer reader. As you read each essay carefully take note of the content and the structure as well as the thesis statement, topic sentences, and supporting evidence. These should shape your response to the essay and should also shape your writing.</p>
