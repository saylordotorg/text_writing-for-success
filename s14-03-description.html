        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Description in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s01_p01">Writers use description in writing to make sure that their audience is fully immersed in the words on the page. This requires a concerted effort by the writer to describe his or her world through the use of sensory details.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s01_p02">As mentioned earlier in this chapter, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sensory details</a><span class="glossdef">Descriptions that appeal to our sense of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.</span></span> are descriptions that appeal to our sense of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Your descriptions should try to focus on the five senses because we all rely on these senses to experience the world. The use of sensory details, then, provides you the greatest possibility of relating to your audience and thus engaging them in your writing, making descriptive writing important not only during your education but also during everyday situations.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s01_p03">Avoid empty descriptors if possible. Empty descriptors are adjectives that can mean different things to different people. <em class="emphasis">Good</em>, <em class="emphasis">beautiful</em>, <em class="emphasis">terrific</em>, and <em class="emphasis">nice</em> are examples. The use of such words in descriptions can lead to misreads and confusion. <em class="emphasis">A good day</em>, for instance, can mean far different things depending on one’s age, personality, or tastes.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s01_p04">Whether you are presenting a new product or service to a client, training new employees, or brainstorming ideas with colleagues, the use of clear, evocative detail is crucial. Make an effort to use details that express your thoughts in a way that will register with others. Sharp, concise details are always impressive.</p>

The structure of a descriptive essay is more flexible than in some of the other rhetorical modes. The introduction of a description essay should set up the tone and point of the essay. The thesis should convey the writer’s overall impression of the person, place, or object described in the body paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s02_p02">The organization of the essay may best follow <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spatial order</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to physical characteristics or appearance.</span></span>, an arrangement of ideas according to physical characteristics or appearance. Depending on what the writer describes, the organization could move from top to bottom, left to right, near to far, warm to cold, frightening to inviting, and so on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s02_p03">For example, if the subject were a client’s kitchen in the midst of renovation, you might start at one side of the room and move slowly across to the other end, describing appliances, cabinetry, and so on. Or you might choose to start with older remnants of the kitchen and progress to the new installations. Maybe start with the floor and move up toward the ceiling.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s03_p02">The remainder of your essay describes your subject in a way that best expresses your thesis. Remember, you should have a strong sense of how you will organize your essay. Choose a strategy and stick to it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s03_s03_p03">Every part of your essay should use vivid sensory details. The more you can appeal to your readers’ senses, the more they will be engaged in your essay.

Expanding on ideas in greater detail can be difficult. Sometimes it is helpful to look closely at each of the sentences in a summary paragraph.
