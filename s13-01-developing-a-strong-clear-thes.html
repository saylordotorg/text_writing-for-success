    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_p01">Have you ever known a person who was not very good at telling stories? You probably had trouble following his train of thought as he jumped around from point to point, either being too brief in places that needed further explanation or providing too many details on a meaningless element. Maybe he told the end of the story first, then moved to the beginning and later added details to the middle. His ideas were probably scattered, and the story did not flow very well. When the story was over, you probably had many questions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_p02">Just as a personal anecdote can be a disorganized mess, an essay can fall into the same trap of being out of order and confusing. That is why writers need a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis statement</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay. A thesis statement is often one sentence long and states the writer’s point of view.</span></span> to provide a specific focus for their essay and to organize what they are about to discuss in the body.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_p03">Just like a topic sentence summarizes a single paragraph, the thesis statement summarizes an entire essay. It tells the reader the point you want to make in your essay, while the essay itself supports that point. It is like a signpost that signals the essay’s destination. You should form your thesis before you begin to organize an essay, but you may find that it needs revision as the essay develops.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Elements of a Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_p01">For every essay you write, you must focus on a central idea. This idea stems from a topic you have chosen or been assigned or from a question your teacher has asked. It is not enough merely to discuss a general topic or simply answer a question with a yes or no. You have to form a specific opinion, and then articulate that into a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controlling idea</a><span class="glossdef">The main idea that guides the content of an essay; the idea upon which a thesis statement is built.</span></span>—the main idea upon which you build your thesis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_p02">Remember that a thesis is not the topic itself, but rather your interpretation of the question or subject. For whatever topic your professor gives you, you must ask yourself, “What do I want to say about it?” Asking and then answering this question is vital to forming a thesis that is precise, forceful and confident.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_p03">A thesis is one sentence long and appears toward the end of your introduction. It is specific and focuses on one to three points of a single idea—points that are able to be demonstrated in the body. It forecasts the content of the essay and suggests how you will organize your information. Remember that a thesis statement does not summarize an issue but rather dissects it.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">A Strong Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p01">A strong thesis statement contains the following qualities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Specificity.</strong> A thesis statement must concentrate on a specific area of a general topic. As you may recall, the creation of a thesis statement begins when you choose a broad subject and then narrow down its parts until you pinpoint a specific aspect of that topic. For example, health care is a broad topic, but a proper thesis statement would focus on a specific area of that topic, such as options for individuals without health care coverage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Precision.</strong> A strong thesis statement must be precise enough to allow for a coherent argument and to remain focused on the topic. If the specific topic is options for individuals without health care coverage, then your precise thesis statement must make an exact claim about it, such as that limited options exist for those who are uninsured by their employers. You must further pinpoint what you are going to discuss regarding these limited effects, such as whom they affect and what the cause is.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ability to be argued.</strong> A thesis statement must present a relevant and specific argument. A factual statement often is not considered arguable. Be sure your thesis statement contains a point of view that can be supported with evidence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ability to be demonstrated.</strong> For any claim you make in your thesis, you must be able to provide reasons and examples for your opinion. You can rely on personal observations in order to do this, or you can consult outside sources to demonstrate that what you assert is valid. A worthy argument is backed by examples and details.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Forcefulness.</strong> A thesis statement that is forceful shows readers that you are, in fact, making an argument. The tone is assertive and takes a stance that others might oppose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Confidence.</strong> In addition to using force in your thesis statement, you must also use confidence in your claim. Phrases such as <em class="emphasis">I feel</em> or <em class="emphasis">I believe</em> actually weaken the readers’ sense of your confidence because these phrases imply that you are the only person who feels the way you do. In other words, your stance has insufficient backing. Taking an authoritative stance on the matter persuades your readers to have faith in your argument and open their minds to what you have to say.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p08">Even in a personal essay that allows the use of first person, your thesis should not contain phrases such as <em class="emphasis">in my opinion</em> or <em class="emphasis">I believe</em>. These statements reduce your credibility and weaken your argument. Your opinion is more convincing when you use a firm attitude.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p01">You can cut down on irrelevant aspects and revise your thesis by taking the following steps:</p>

                <li>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p04">The revised thesis makes a more specific statement about success and what it means to work hard. The original includes too broad a range of people and does not define exactly what success entails. By replacing those general words like <em class="emphasis">people</em> and <em class="emphasis">work hard</em>, the writer can better focus his or her research and gain more direction in his or her writing.</p>

The writer should ask himself or herself questions similar to the 5WH questions. (See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> for more information on the 5WH questions.) By incorporating the answers to these questions into a thesis statement, the writer more accurately defines his or her stance, which will better guide the writing of the essay.</p>

You then completed a freewriting exercise about an event you recently experienced and chose a general topic to write about. Using that general topic, you then narrowed it down by answering the 5WH questions. After you answered these questions, you chose one of the three methods of prewriting and gathered possible supporting points for your working thesis statement.</p>

The proposal would aim to fix the problem; using a thesis statement would clearly state the boundaries of the problem and tell the goals of the project. After writing the proposal, you may find that the thesis needs revision to reflect exactly what is expressed in the body. Using the techniques from this chapter would apply to revising that thesis.</p>
