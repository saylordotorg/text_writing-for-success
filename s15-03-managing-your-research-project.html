    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_p01">The prewriting you have completed so far has helped you begin to plan the content of your research paper—your topic, research questions, and preliminary thesis. It is equally important to plan out the process of researching and writing the paper. Although some types of writing assignments can be completed relatively quickly, developing a good research paper is a complex process that takes time. Breaking it into manageable steps is crucial. Review the steps outlined at the beginning of this chapter.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_p02">You have already completed step 1. In this section, you will complete step 2. The remaining steps fall under two broad categories—the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research phase</a><span class="glossdef">The first phase of a research project in which the writer gathers and organizes information. A good rule of thumb is to allot half the available time for research.</span></span> of the project (steps 3 and 4) and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">writing phase</a><span class="glossdef">The second phase of a research project in which the writer drafts, revises, and edits the paper. Plan to spend half the time available on this phase. (You may spend additional time if your instructor reviews your rough draft and provides feedback.)</span></span> (steps 5 and 6). Both phases present challenges. Understanding the tasks involved and allowing enough time to complete each task will help you complete your research paper on time with a minimal amount of stress.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Planning Your Project</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p01">Each step of a research project requires time and attention. Careful planning helps ensure that you will keep your project running smoothly and produce your best work. Set up a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">project schedule</a><span class="glossdef">A document outlining the tasks involved in each step of the research project with a target date for completing each step.</span></span> that shows when you will complete each step. Think about <em class="emphasis">how</em> you will complete each step and what <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">project resources</a><span class="glossdef">The documents, tools, or people that a writer relies on to complete a research project. Examples of project resources include library databases, personal computers, style guides, and tutors.</span></span> you will use. Resources may include anything from library databases and word-processing software to interview subjects and writing tutors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p02">To develop your schedule, use a calendar and work backward from the date your final draft is due. Generally, it is wise to divide half of the available time on the research phase of the project and half on the writing phase. For example, if you have a month to work, plan for two weeks for each phase. If you have a full semester, plan to begin research early and to start writing by the middle of the term. You might think that no one really works that far ahead, but try it. You will probably be pleased with the quality of your work and with the reduction in your stress level.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p03">As you plan, break down major steps into smaller tasks if necessary. For example, step 3, conducting research, involves locating potential sources, evaluating their usefulness and reliability, reading, and taking notes. Defining these smaller tasks makes the project more manageable by giving you concrete goals to achieve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p04">Jorge had six weeks to complete his research project. Working backward from a due date of May 2, he mapped out a schedule for completing his research by early April so that he would have ample time to write. Jorge chose to write his schedule in his weekly planner to help keep himself on track.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p05">Review Jorge’s schedule. Key target dates are shaded. Note that Jorge planned times to use available resources by visiting the library and writing center and by meeting with his instructor.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p06">Plan your schedule realistically, and consider other commitments that may sometimes take precedence. A business trip or family visit may mean that you are unable to work on the research project for a few days. Make the most of the time you have available. Plan for unexpected interruptions, but keep in mind that a short time away from the project may help you come back to it with renewed enthusiasm. Another strategy many writers find helpful is to finish each day’s work at a point when the next task is an easy one. That makes it easier to start again.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p07">When you create a project schedule at work, you set target dates for completing certain tasks and identify the resources you plan to use on the project. It is important to build in some flexibility. Materials may not be received on time because of a shipping delay. An employee on your team may be called away to work on a higher-priority project. Essential equipment may malfunction. You should always plan for the unexpected.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Staying Organized</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s02_p01">Although setting up a schedule is easy, sticking to one is challenging. Even if you are the rare person who never procrastinates, unforeseen events may interfere with your ability to complete tasks on time. A self-imposed deadline may slip your mind despite your best intentions. Organizational tools—calendars, checklists, note cards, software, and so forth—can help you stay on track.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Throughout your project, organize both your time and your resources systematically. Review your schedule frequently and check your progress. It helps to post your schedule in a place where you will see it every day. Both personal and workplace e-mail systems usually include a calendar feature where you can record tasks, arrange to receive daily reminders, and check off completed tasks. Electronic devices such as smartphones have similar features.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s02_p03">Organize project documents in a binder or electronic folder, and label project documents and folders clearly. Use note cards or an electronic document to record bibliographical information for each source you plan to use in your paper. Tracking this information throughout the research process can save you hours of time when you create your references page.</p>

Transfer it into a format that will help you stay on track from day to day. You may wish to input it into your smartphone, write it in a weekly planner, post it by your desk, or have your e-mail account send you daily reminders. Consider setting up a buddy system with a classmate that will help you both stay on track.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s02_p05">Some people enjoy using the most up-to-date technology to help them stay organized. Other people prefer simple methods, such as crossing off items on a checklist. The key to staying organized is finding a system you like enough to use daily. The particulars of the method are not important as long as you are consistent.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Anticipating Challenges</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p01">Do any of these scenarios sound familiar? You have identified a book that would be a great resource for your project, but it is currently checked out of the library. You planned to interview a subject matter expert on your topic, but she calls to reschedule your meeting. You have begun writing your draft, but now you realize that you will need to modify your thesis and conduct additional research. Or you have finally completed your draft when your computer crashes, and days of hard work disappear in an instant.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p02">These troubling situations are all too common. No matter how carefully you plan your schedule, you may encounter a glitch or setback. Managing your project effectively means anticipating potential problems, taking steps to minimize them where possible, and allowing time in your schedule to handle any setbacks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p03">Many times a situation becomes a problem due only to lack of planning. For example, if a book is checked out of your local library, it might be available through interlibrary loan, which usually takes a few days for the library staff to process. Alternatively, you might locate another, equally useful source. If you have allowed enough time for research, a brief delay will not become a major setback.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p04">You can manage other potential problems by staying organized and maintaining a take-charge attitude. Take a minute each day to save a backup copy of your work on a portable hard drive. Maintain detailed note cards and source cards as you conduct research—doing so will make citing sources in your draft infinitely easier. If you run into difficulties with your research or your writing, ask your instructor for help, or make an appointment with a writing tutor.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p05">Identify five potential problems you might encounter in the process of researching and writing your paper. Write them on a separate sheet of paper. For each problem, write at least one strategy for solving the problem or minimizing its effect on your project.</p>

        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p06">In the workplace, documents prepared at the beginning of a project often include a detailed plan for risk management. When you manage a project, it makes sense to anticipate and prepare for potential setbacks. For example, to roll out a new product line, a software development company must strive to complete tasks on a schedule in order to meet the new product release date. The project manager may need to adjust the project plan if one or more tasks fall behind schedule.</p>
