    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s01_p01">If your first language is not English, you will most likely need some extra help when writing in Standard, or formal, English. New students of Standard English often make similar kinds of errors. Even if you have been speaking English for a long time, you may not feel as confident in your written English skills. This chapter covers the most common errors made by English language learners and helps you avoid similar mistakes in your writing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Basic Sentence Structures</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s01_s01_p01">The most basic sentence structure in English is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subject</a><span class="glossdef">A word that tells what the sentence is about. Subjects are usually nouns or pronouns.</span></span> plus a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">verb</a><span class="glossdef">A word that tells what the subject is doing or links the subject to a describing word.</span></span>. A subject performs the action in the sentence, and the verb identifies the action. Keep in mind that in some languages, such as Spanish and Italian, an obvious subject does not always perform the action in a sentence; the subject is often implied by the verb. However, every sentence in English must have a subject and a verb to express a complete thought.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Not all sentences are as simple as a subject plus a verb. To form more complex sentences, writers build upon this basic structure. Adding a prepositional phrase to the basic sentence creates a more complex sentence. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">preposition</a><span class="glossdef">Type of word that connects a noun, pronoun, or verb to another word that describes or modifies it. Common prepositions include <em class="emphasis">in</em>, <em class="emphasis">on</em>, <em class="emphasis">under</em>, <em class="emphasis">near</em>, <em class="emphasis">by</em>, <em class="emphasis">with</em>, and <em class="emphasis">about</em>.</span></span> is a part of speech that relates a noun or a pronoun to another word in a sentence. It also introduces a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prepositional phrase</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that begins with a preposition.</span></span>. If you can identify a preposition, you will be able to identify a prepositional phrase.</p>

The sentence sounds a bit strange because <em class="emphasis">Afrah</em> is named twice; however, if you use a pronoun, the sentence will be shorter and less repetitive.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s05_s02_p01">Up to this point, we have studied the three simple verb tenses—simple present, simple past, and simple future. Now we will add three more tenses, which are called perfect tenses. They are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">present perfect</a><span class="glossdef">Verb tense that describe a continuing situation or something that has just happened.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">past perfect</a><span class="glossdef">Verb tenses that describe a continuing situation in the past.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">future perfect</a><span class="glossdef">Verb tense used when anticipating completing an event in the future, but the event is not completed yet.</span></span>. These are the three basic tenses of English. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">past participle</a><span class="glossdef">Often called the -<em class="emphasis">ed</em> form of the verb, it is formed by adding -<em class="emphasis">d</em> or -<em class="emphasis">ed</em> to the base form of regular verbs.</span></span> is often called the -<em class="emphasis">ed</em> form of a verb because it is formed by adding -<em class="emphasis">d</em> or -<em class="emphasis">ed</em> to the base form of regular verbs. Past participles can also end in <em class="emphasis">-t</em> or <em class="emphasis">-en</em>. Keep in mind, however, the past participle is also formed in various other ways for irregular verbs. The past participle can be used to form the present perfect tense.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s08_p01">Words are the basis of how a reader or listener judges you, the writer and speaker. When you write an academic paper or speak in a business interview, you want to be sure to choose your words carefully. In our casual, everyday talk, we often use a lot of “ums,” “likes,” “yeahs,” and so on. This everyday language is not appropriate for formal contexts, such as academic papers and business interviews. You should switch between different ways of speaking and writing depending on whether the context is formal or informal.</p>

You might notice that the language sounds informal, or casual, like someone might talk with a friend or family member. The paragraph also uses a lot of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">slang</a><span class="glossdef">Informal words that are considered nonstandard English.</span></span>. Slang is a type of language that is informal and playful. It often changes over time. The slang of the past is different than the slang of today, but some slang has carried over into the present. Slang also varies by region and culture. The important thing to understand is that slang is casual talk, and you should avoid using it in formal contexts. There are literally thousands of slang words and expressions. <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch05_s08_s01_t01">Table 5.17 "Slang Expressions"</a> explains just a few of the more common terms.</p>
