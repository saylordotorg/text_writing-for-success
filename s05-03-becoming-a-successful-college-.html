    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_p01">In the preceding sections, you learned what you can expect from college and identified strategies you can use to manage your work. These strategies will help you succeed in any college course. This section covers more about how to handle the demands college places upon you as a writer. The general techniques you will learn will help ensure your success on any writing task, whether you complete a bluebook exam in an hour or an in-depth research project over several weeks.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Putting It All Together: Strategies for Success</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Writing well is difficult. Even people who write for a living sometimes struggle to get their thoughts on the page. Even people who generally enjoy writing have days when they would rather do anything else. For people who do not like writing or do not think of themselves as good writers, writing assignments can be stressful or even intimidating. And of course, you cannot get through college without having to write—sometimes a lot, and often at a higher level than you are used to.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_p02">No magic formula will make writing quick and easy. However, you can use strategies and resources to manage writing assignments more easily. This section presents a broad overview of these strategies and resources. The remaining chapters of this book provide more detailed, comprehensive instruction to help you succeed at a variety of assignments. College will challenge you as a writer, but it is also a unique opportunity to grow.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Using the Writing Process</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p01">To complete a writing project successfully, good writers use some variation of the following process.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_n01">
                <h3 class="title">The Writing Process</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prewriting.</strong> In this step, the writer generates ideas to write about and begins developing these ideas.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Outlining a structure of ideas.</strong> In this step, the writer determines the overall organizational structure of the writing and creates an outline to organize ideas. Usually this step involves some additional fleshing out of the ideas generated in the first step.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Writing a rough draft.</strong> In this step, the writer uses the work completed in prewriting to develop a first draft. The draft covers the ideas the writer brainstormed and follows the organizational plan that was laid out in the first step.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Revising.</strong> In this step, the writer revisits the draft to review and, if necessary, reshape its content. This stage involves moderate and sometimes major changes: adding or deleting a paragraph, phrasing the main point differently, expanding on an important idea, reorganizing content, and so forth.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Editing.</strong> In this step, the writer reviews the draft to make additional changes. Editing involves making changes to improve style and adherence to standard writing conventions—for instance, replacing a vague word with a more precise one or fixing errors in grammar and spelling. Once this stage is complete, the work is a finished piece and ready to share with others.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p02">Chances are, you have already used this process as a writer. You may also have used it for other types of creative projects, such as developing a sketch into a finished painting or composing a song. The steps listed above apply broadly to any project that involves creative thinking. You come up with ideas (often vague at first), you work to give them some structure, you make a first attempt, you figure out what needs improving, and then you refine it until you are satisfied.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p03">Most people have used this creative process in one way or another, but many people have misconceptions about how to use it to write. Here are a few of the most common misconceptions students have about the writing process:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_l02">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“I do not have to waste time on prewriting if I understand the assignment.”</strong> Even if the task is straightforward and you feel ready to start writing, take some time to develop ideas before you plunge into your draft. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Freewriting</a><span class="glossdef">A prewriting strategy in which writers write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes).</span></span>—writing about the topic without stopping for a set period of time—is one prewriting technique you might try in that situation.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“It is important to complete a formal, numbered outline for every writing assignment.”</strong> For some assignments, such as lengthy research papers, proceeding without a formal outline can be very difficult. However, for other assignments, a structured set of notes or a detailed graphic organizer may suffice. The important thing is that you have a solid plan for organizing ideas and details.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“My draft will be better if I write it when I am feeling inspired.”</strong> By all means, take advantage of those moments of inspiration. However, understand that sometimes you will have to write when you are not in the mood. Sit down and start your draft even if you do not feel like it. If necessary, force yourself to write for just one hour. By the end of the hour, you may be far more engaged and motivated to continue. If not, at least you will have accomplished part of the task.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“My instructor will tell me everything I need to revise.”</strong> If your instructor chooses to review drafts, the feedback can help you improve. However, it is still your job, not your instructor’s, to transform the draft to a final, polished piece. That task will be much easier if you give your best effort to the draft before submitting it. During revision, do not just go through and implement your instructor’s corrections. Take time to determine what you can change to make the work the best it can be.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“I am a good writer, so I do not need to revise or edit.”</strong> Even talented writers still need to revise and edit their work. At the very least, doing so will help you catch an embarrassing typo or two. Revising and editing are the steps that make good writers into great writers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p04">For a more thorough explanation of the steps of the writing process as well as for specific techniques you can use for each step, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p05">The writing process also applies to timed writing tasks, such as essay exams. Before you begin writing, read the question thoroughly and think about the main points to include in your response. Use scrap paper to sketch out a very brief outline. Keep an eye on the clock as you write your response so you will have time to review it and make any needed changes before turning in your exam.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Your Time</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p01">In <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch01_s02#fresh-ch01_s02">Section 1.2 "Developing Study Skills"</a>, you learned general time-management skills. By combining those skills with what you have learned about the writing process, you can make any writing assignment easier to manage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p02">When your instructor gives you a writing assignment, write the due date on your calendar. Then work backward from the due date to set aside blocks of time when you will work on the assignment. Always plan at least two sessions of writing time per assignment, so that you are not trying to move from step 1 to step 5 in one evening. Trying to work that fast is stressful, and it does not yield great results. You will plan better, think better, and write better if you space out the steps.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p03">Ideally, you should set aside at least three separate blocks of time to work on a writing assignment: one for prewriting and outlining, one for drafting, and one for revising and editing. Sometimes those steps may be compressed into just a few days. If you have a couple of weeks to work on a paper, space out the five steps over multiple sessions. Long-term projects, such as research papers, require more time for each step.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p04">In certain situations you may not be able to allow time between the different steps of the writing process. For instance, you may be asked to write in class or complete a brief response paper overnight. If the time available is very limited, apply a modified version of the writing process (as you would do for an essay exam). It is still important to give the assignment thought and effort. However, these types of assignments are less formal, and instructors may not expect them to be as polished as formal papers. When in doubt, ask the instructor about expectations, resources that will be available during the writing exam, and if they have any tips to prepare you to effectively demonstrate your writing skills.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p05">Each Monday in Crystal’s Foundations of Education class, the instructor distributed copies of a current news article on education and assigned students to write a one-and-one-half- to two-page response that was due the following Monday. Together, these weekly assignments counted for 20 percent of the course grade. Although each response took just a few hours to complete, Crystal found that she learned more from the reading and got better grades on her writing if she spread the work out in the following way:</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">

            <h2 class="title editable block">Setting Goals</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p01">One key to succeeding as a student and as a writer is setting both short- and long-term goals for yourself. You have already glimpsed the kind of short-term goals a student might set. Crystal wanted to do well in her Foundations of Education course, and she realized that she could control how she handled her weekly writing assignments. At 20 percent of her course grade, she reasoned, those assignments might mean the difference between a C and a B or between a B and an A.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p02">By planning carefully and following through on her daily and weekly goals, Crystal was able to fulfill one of her goals for the semester. Although her exam scores were not as high as she had hoped, her consistently strong performance on writing assignments tipped her grade from a B+ to an A−. She was pleased to have earned a high grade in one of the required courses for her major. She was also glad to have gotten the most out of an introductory course that would help her become an effective teacher.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p03">How does Crystal’s experience relate to your own college experience?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p04">To do well in college, it is important to stay focused on how your day-to-day actions determine your long-term success. You may not have defined your career goals or chosen a major yet. Even so, you surely have some overarching goals for what you want out of college: to expand your career options, to increase your earning power, or just to learn something new. In time, you will define your long-term goals more explicitly. Doing solid, steady work, day by day and week by week, will help you meet those goals.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p05">In this exercise, make connections between short- and long-term goals.</p>

                    <li>For this step, identify one long-term goal you would like to have achieved by the time you complete your degree. For instance, you might want a particular job in your field or hope to graduate with honors.</li>
                    <li>Next, identify one semester goal that will help you fulfill the goal you set in step one. For instance, you may want to do well in a particular course or establish a connection with a professional in your field.</li>
                    <li>Review the goal you determined in step two. Brainstorm a list of stepping stones that will help you meet that goal, such as “doing well on my midterm and final exams” or “talking to Professor Gibson about doing an internship.” Write down everything you can think of that would help you meet that semester goal.</li>
                    <li>Review your list. Choose two to three items, and for each item identify at least one concrete action you can take to accomplish it. These actions may be recurring (meeting with a study group each week) or one time only (calling the professor in charge of internships).</li>
                    <li>Identify one action from step four that you can do today. Then do it.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Using College Resources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p01">One reason students sometimes find college overwhelming is that they do not know about, or are reluctant to use, the resources available to them. Some aspects of college will be challenging. However, if you try to handle every challenge alone, you may become frustrated and overwhelmed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p02">Universities have resources in place to help students cope with challenges. Your student fees help pay for resources such as a health center or tutoring, so use these resources if you need them. The following are some of the resources you might use if you find you need help:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Your instructor.</strong> If you are making an honest effort but still struggling with a particular course, set up a time to meet with your instructor and discuss what you can do to improve. He or she may be able to shed light on a confusing concept or give you strategies to catch up.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Your academic counselor.</strong> Many universities assign students an academic counselor who can help you choose courses and ensure that you fulfill degree and major requirements.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The academic resource center.</strong> These centers offer a variety of services, which may range from general coaching in study skills to tutoring for specific courses. Find out what is offered at your school and use the services that you need.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The writing center.</strong> These centers employ tutors to help you manage college-level writing assignments. They will not write or edit your paper for you, but they can help you through the stages of the writing process. (In some schools, the writing center is part of the academic resource center.)</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The career resource center.</strong> Visit the career resource center for guidance in choosing a career path, developing a résumé, and finding and applying for jobs.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Counseling services.</strong> Many universities offer psychological counseling for free or for a low fee. Use these services if you need help coping with a difficult personal situation or managing depression, anxiety, or other problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p03">Students sometimes neglect to use available resources due to limited time, unwillingness to admit there is a problem, or embarrassment about needing to ask for help. Unfortunately, ignoring a problem usually makes it harder to cope with later on. Waiting until the end of the semester may also mean fewer resources are available, since many other students are also seeking last-minute help.</p>
