    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_p02">Even professional writers admit that an empty page scares them because they feel they need to come up with something fresh and original every time they open a blank document on their computers. Because you have completed the first two steps in the writing process, you have already recovered from empty page syndrome. You have hours of prewriting and planning already done. You know what will go on that blank page: what you wrote in your outline.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Getting Started: Strategies For Drafting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_p01">Your objective for this portion of <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> is to draft the body paragraphs of a standard five-paragraph essay. A five-paragraph essay contains an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. If you are more comfortable starting on paper than on the computer, you can start on paper and then type it before you revise. You can also use a voice recorder to get yourself started, dictating a paragraph or two to get you thinking. In this lesson, Mariah does all her work on the computer, but you may use pen and paper or the computer to write a rough draft.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Making the Writing Process Work for You</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">What makes the writing process so beneficial to writers is that it encourages alternatives to standard practices while motivating you to develop your best ideas. For instance, the following approaches, done alone or in combination with others, may improve your writing and help you move forward in the writing process:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Begin writing with the part you know the most about.</strong> You can start with the third paragraph in your outline if ideas come easily to mind. You can start with the second paragraph or the first paragraph, too. Although paragraphs may vary in length, keep in mind that short paragraphs may contain insufficient support. Readers may also think the writing is abrupt. Long paragraphs may be wordy and may lose your reader’s interest. As a guideline, try to write paragraphs longer than one sentence but shorter than the length of an entire double-spaced page.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Write one paragraph at a time and then stop.</strong> As long as you complete the assignment on time, you may choose how many paragraphs you complete in one sitting. Pace yourself. On the other hand, try not to procrastinate. Writers should always meet their deadlines.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take short breaks to refresh your mind.</strong> This tip might be most useful if you are writing a multipage report or essay. Still, if you are antsy or cannot concentrate, take a break to let your mind rest. But do not let breaks extend too long. If you spend too much time away from your essay, you may have trouble starting again. You may forget key points or lose momentum. Try setting an alarm to limit your break, and when the time is up, return to your desk to write.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be reasonable with your goals.</strong> If you decide to take ten-minute breaks, try to stick to that goal. If you told yourself that you need more facts, then commit to finding them. Holding yourself to your own goals will create successful writing assignments.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your audience and purpose in mind as you write.</strong> These aspects of writing are just as important when you are writing a single paragraph for your essay as when you are considering the direction of the entire essay.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p02">Of all of these considerations, keeping your purpose and your audience at the front of your mind is the most important key to writing success. If your purpose is to persuade, for example, you will present your facts and details in the most logical and convincing way you can.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p03">Your purpose will guide your mind as you compose your sentences. Your audience will guide word choice. Are you writing for experts, for a general audience, for other college students, or for people who know very little about your topic? Keep asking yourself what your readers, with their background and experience, need to be told in order to understand your ideas. How can you best express your ideas so they are totally clear and your communication is effective?</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p04">You may want to identify your purpose and audience on an index card that you clip to your paper (or keep next to your computer). On that card, you may want to write notes to yourself—perhaps about what that audience might not know or what it needs to know—so that you will be sure to address those issues when you write. It may be a good idea to also state exactly what you want to explain to that audience, or to inform them of, or to persuade them about.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p05">Many of the documents you produce at work target a particular audience for a particular purpose. You may find that it is highly advantageous to know as much as you can about your target audience and to prepare your message to reach that audience, even if the audience is a coworker or your boss. Menu language is a common example. Descriptions like “organic romaine” and “free-range chicken” are intended to appeal to a certain type of customer though perhaps not to the same customer who craves a thick steak. Similarly, mail-order companies research the demographics of the people who buy their merchandise. Successful vendors customize product descriptions in catalogs to appeal to their buyers’ tastes. For example, the product descriptions in a skateboarder catalog will differ from the descriptions in a clothing catalog for mature adults.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p01">A draft is a complete version of a piece of writing, but it is not the final version. The step in the writing process after drafting, as you may remember, is revising. During revising, you will have the opportunity to make changes to your first draft before you put the finishing touches on it during the editing and proofreading stage. A first draft gives you a working version that you can later improve.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p02">Workplace writing in certain environments is done by teams of writers who collaborate on the planning, writing, and revising of documents, such as long reports, technical manuals, and the results of scientific research. Collaborators do not need to be in the same room, the same building, or even the same city. Many collaborations are conducted over the Internet.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p03">In a perfect collaboration, each contributor has the right to add, edit, and delete text. Strong communication skills, in addition to strong writing skills, are important in this kind of writing situation because disagreements over style, content, process, emphasis, and other issues may arise.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p04">The collaborative software, or document management systems, that groups use to work on common projects is sometimes called groupware or workgroup support systems.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p05">The reviewing tool on some word-processing programs also gives you access to a collaborative tool that many smaller workgroups use when they exchange documents. You can also use it to leave comments to yourself.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p06">If you invest some time now to investigate how the reviewing tool in your word processor works, you will be able to use it with confidence during the revision stage of the writing process. Then, when you start to revise, set your reviewing tool to track any changes you make, so you will be able to tinker with text and commit only those final changes you want to keep.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p01">If you have been using the information in this chapter step by step to help you develop an assignment, you already have both a formal topic outline and a formal sentence outline to direct your writing. Knowing what a first draft looks like will help you make the creative leap from the outline to the first draft. A first draft should include the following elements:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">introduction</a><span class="glossdef">The opening paragraph of an essay that piques the audience’s interest, tells what the essay is about, and motivates the audience to keep reading.</span></span> that piques the audience’s interest, tells what the essay is about, and motivates readers to keep reading.</li>

                <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">The sentence in a paragraph that controls the point of the paragraph. A topic sentence is most often located at the beginning of a paragraph, and it makes the structure of a text and the writer’s basic arguments easy to locate and comprehend.</span></span> in each paragraph that states the main idea of the paragraph and implies how that main idea connects to the thesis statement.</li>
                <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Supporting sentences</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence in the middle part of the paragraph that helps explain, enhance, or prove the topic sentence.</span></span> in each paragraph that develop or explain the topic sentence.

                <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conclusion</a><span class="glossdef">The closing paragraph of an essay that reinforces the thesis statement and leaves the audience with a feeling of completion.</span></span> that reinforces the thesis statement and leaves the audience with a feeling of completion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p02">These elements follow the standard five-paragraph essay format, which you probably first encountered in high school. This basic format is valid for most essays you will write in college, even much longer ones. For now, however, Mariah focuses on writing the three body paragraphs from her outline. <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a> covers writing introductions and conclusions, and you will read Mariah’s introduction and conclusion in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of Topic Sentences</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p01">Topic sentences make the structure of a text and the writer’s basic arguments easy to locate and comprehend. In college writing, using a topic sentence in each paragraph of the essay is the standard rule. However, the topic sentence does not always have to be the first sentence in your paragraph even if it the first item in your formal outline.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_n01">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p02">When you begin to draft your paragraphs, you should follow your outline fairly closely. After all, you spent valuable time developing those ideas. However, as you begin to express your ideas in complete sentences, it might strike you that the topic sentence might work better at the end of the paragraph or in the middle. Try it. Writing a draft, by its nature, is a good time for experimentation.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p03">The topic sentence can be the first, middle, or final sentence in a paragraph. The assignment’s audience and purpose will often determine where a topic sentence belongs. When the purpose of the assignment is to persuade, for example, the topic sentence should be the first sentence in a paragraph. In a persuasive essay, the writer’s point of view should be clearly expressed at the beginning of each paragraph.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p04">Choosing where to position the topic sentence depends not only on your audience and purpose but also on the essay’s arrangement, or order. When you organize information according to order of importance, the topic sentence may be the final sentence in a paragraph. All the supporting sentences build up to the topic sentence. Chronological order may also position the topic sentence as the final sentence because the controlling idea of the paragraph may make the most sense at the end of a sequence.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p05">When you organize information according to spatial order, a topic sentence may appear as the middle sentence in a paragraph. An essay arranged by spatial order often contains paragraphs that begin with descriptions. A reader may first need a visual in his or her mind before understanding the development of the paragraph. When the topic sentence is in the middle, it unites the details that come before it with the ones that come after it.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_n02">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p06">As you read critically throughout the writing process, keep topic sentences in mind. You may discover topic sentences that are not always located at the beginning of a paragraph. For example, fiction writers customarily use topic ideas, either expressed or implied, to move readers through their texts. In nonfiction writing, such as popular magazines, topic sentences are often used when the author thinks it is appropriate (based on the audience and the purpose, of course). A single topic sentence might even control the development of a number of paragraphs. For more information on topic sentences, please see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch06#fresh-ch06">Chapter 6 "Writing Paragraphs: Separating Ideas and Shaping Content"</a>.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p07">Developing topic sentences and thinking about their placement in a paragraph will prepare you to write the rest of the paragraph.</p>

            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Paragraphs</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p01">The paragraph is the main structural component of an essay as well as other forms of writing. Each paragraph of an essay adds another related main idea to support the writer’s thesis, or controlling idea. Each related main idea is supported and developed with facts, examples, and other details that explain it. By exploring and refining one main idea at a time, writers build a strong case for their thesis.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Paragraph Length</strong></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p03">How long should a paragraph be?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p04">One answer to this important question may be “long enough”—long enough for you to address your points and explain your main idea. To grab attention or to present succinct supporting ideas, a paragraph can be fairly short and consist of two to three sentences. A paragraph in a complex essay about some abstract point in philosophy or archaeology can be three-quarters of a page or more in length. As long as the writer maintains close focus on the topic and does not ramble, a long paragraph is acceptable in college-level writing. In general, try to keep the paragraphs longer than one sentence but shorter than one full page of double-spaced text.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_n01">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p05">Journalistic style often calls for brief two- or three-sentence paragraphs because of how people read the news, both online and in print. Blogs and other online information sources often adopt this paragraphing style, too. Readers often skim the first paragraphs of a great many articles before settling on the handful of stories they want to read in detail.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p06">You may find that a particular paragraph you write may be longer than one that will hold your audience’s interest. In such cases, you should divide the paragraph into two or more shorter paragraphs, adding a topic statement or some kind of transitional word or phrase at the start of the new paragraph. Transition words or phrases show the connection between the two ideas.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p07">In all cases, however, be guided by what you instructor wants and expects to find in your draft. Many instructors will expect you to develop a mature college-level style as you progress through the semester’s assignments.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p04">Mariah chose to begin by writing a quick introduction based on her thesis statement. She knew that she would want to improve her introduction significantly when she revised. Right now, she just wanted to give herself a starting point. You will read her introduction again in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08_s04#fresh-ch08_s04">Section 8.4 "Revising and Editing"</a> when she revises it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p07">With her thesis statement and her purpose and audience notes in front of her, Mariah then looked at her sentence outline. She chose to use that outline because it includes the topic sentences. The following is the portion of her outline for the first body paragraph. The roman numeral II identifies the topic sentence for the paragraph, capital letters indicate supporting details, and arabic numerals label subpoints.</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p08">Mariah then began to expand the ideas in her outline into a paragraph. Notice how the outline helped her guarantee that all her sentences in the body of the paragraph develop the topic sentence.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p09">If you write your first draft on the computer, consider creating a new file folder for each course with a set of subfolders inside the course folders for each assignment you are given. Label the folders clearly with the course names, and label each assignment folder and word processing document with a title that you will easily recognize. The assignment name is a good choice for the document. Then use that subfolder to store all the drafts you create. When you start each new draft, do not just write over the last one. Instead, save the draft with a new tag after the title—draft 1, draft 2, and so on—so that you will have a complete history of drafts in case your instructor wishes you to submit them.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p10">In your documents, observe any formatting requirements—for margins, headers, placement of page numbers, and other layout matters—that your instructor requires.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercise 3</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p11">Study how Mariah made the transition from her sentence outline to her first draft. First, copy her outline onto your own sheet of paper. Leave a few spaces between each part of the outline. Then copy sentences from Mariah’s paragraph to align each sentence with its corresponding entry in her outline.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p01">Mariah continued writing her essay, moving to the second and third body paragraphs. She had supporting details but no numbered subpoints in her outline, so she had to consult her prewriting notes for specific information to include.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_s01_n01">

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p02">If you decide to take a break between finishing your first body paragraph and starting the next one, do not start writing immediately when you return to your work. Put yourself back in context and in the mood by rereading what you have already written. This is what Mariah did. If she had stopped writing in the middle of writing the paragraph, she could have jotted down some quick notes to herself about what she would write next.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p03">Preceding each body paragraph that Mariah wrote is the appropriate section of her sentence outline. Notice how she expanded roman numeral III from her outline into a first draft of the second body paragraph. As you read, ask yourself how closely she stayed on purpose and how well she paid attention to the needs of her audience.</p>

                    <li>In body paragraph two, Mariah decided to develop her paragraph as a nonfiction narrative. Do you agree with her decision? Explain. How else could she have chosen to develop the paragraph? Why is that better?</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p01">A writer’s best choice for a title is one that alludes to the main point of the entire essay. Like the headline in a newspaper or the big, bold title in a magazine, an essay’s title gives the audience a first peek at the content. If readers like the title, they are likely to keep reading.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_s02_p02">Following her outline carefully, Mariah crafted each paragraph of her essay. Moving step by step in the writing process, Mariah finished the draft and even included a brief concluding paragraph (you will read her conclusion in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>). She then decided, as the final touch for her writing session, to add an engaging title.</p>

                    <li>Make the writing process work for you. Use any and all of the strategies that help you move forward in the writing process.</li>
                    <li>Always be aware of your purpose for writing and the needs of your audience. Cater to those needs in every sensible way.</li>
                    <li>Remember to include all the key structural parts of an essay: a thesis statement that is part of your introductory paragraph, three or more body paragraphs as described in your outline, and a concluding paragraph. Then add an engaging title to draw in readers.</li>
                    <li>Write paragraphs of an appropriate length for your writing assignment. Paragraphs in college-level writing can be a page long, as long as they cover the main topics in your outline.</li>
                    <li>Use your topic outline or your sentence outline to guide the development of your paragraphs and the elaboration of your ideas. Each main idea, indicated by a roman numeral in your outline, becomes the topic of a new paragraph. Develop it with the supporting details and the subpoints of those details that you included in your outline.</li>
                    <li>Generally speaking, write your introduction and conclusion last, after you have fleshed out the body paragraphs.</li>
