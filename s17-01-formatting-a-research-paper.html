It provides a uniform framework for the manuscript and parenthetical citations, or in-text citations.

There are a few major formatting styles used in academic texts, including AMA, Chicago, and Turabian:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_l02">
        <li>AMA (American Medical Association) for medicine, health, and biological sciences</li>
        <li>APA (American Psychological Association) for education, psychology, and the social sciences</li>
        <li>Chicago—a common style used in everyday publications like magazines, newspapers, and books</li>
        <li>MLA (Modern Language Association) for English, literature, arts, and humanities</li>
        <li>Turabian—another common style designed for its universal application across all subjects and disciplines</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p02">While all the formatting and citation styles have their own use and applications, in this chapter we focus our attention on the two styles you are most likely to use in your academic studies: APA and MLA.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p03">If you find that the rules of proper source documentation are difficult to keep straight, you are not alone. Writing a good research paper is, in and of itself, a major intellectual challenge. Having to follow detailed citation and formatting guidelines as well may seem like just one more task to add to an already-too-long list of requirements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p04">Following these guidelines, however, serves several important purposes. First, it signals to your readers that your paper should be taken seriously as a student’s contribution to a given academic or professional field; it is the literary equivalent of wearing a tailored suit to a job interview. Second, it shows that you respect other people’s work enough to give them proper credit for it. Finally, it helps your reader find additional materials if he or she wishes to learn more about your topic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p05">Furthermore, producing a letter-perfect APA-style paper need not be burdensome. Yes, it requires careful attention to detail. However, you can simplify the process if you keep these broad guidelines in mind:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_l03">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Work ahead whenever you can.</strong> <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a> includes tips for keeping track of your sources early in the research process, which will save time later on.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get it right the first time.</strong> Apply APA guidelines as you write, so you will not have much to correct during the editing stage. Again, putting in a little extra time early on can save time later.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use the resources available to you.</strong> In addition to the guidelines provided in this chapter, you may wish to consult the APA website at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.apa.org">http://www.apa.org</a> or the Purdue University Online Writing lab at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu">http://owl.english.purdue.edu</a>, which regularly updates its online style guidelines.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s01_p01">This chapter provides detailed guidelines for using the citation and formatting conventions developed by the American Psychological Association, or APA.

Depending on the length and complexity of the paper, its major sections may also be divided into subsections, sub-subsections, and so on.

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">In-Text Citations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p01">Throughout the body of your paper, include a citation whenever you quote or paraphrase material from your research sources. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, the purpose of citations is twofold: to give credit to others for their ideas and to allow your reader to follow up and learn more about the topic if desired. Your in-text citations provide basic information about your source; each source you cite will have a longer entry in the references section that provides more detailed information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p02">In-text citations must provide the name of the author or authors and the year the source was published. (When a given source does not list an individual author, you may provide the source title or the name of the organization that published the material instead.) When directly quoting a source, it is also required that you include the page number where the quote appears in your citation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p03">This information may be included within the sentence or in a parenthetical reference at the end of the sentence, as in these examples.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_n01">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p04">Epstein (2010) points out that “junk food cannot be considered addictive in the same way that we think of psychoactive drugs as addictive” (p. 137).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p05">Here, the writer names the source author when introducing the quote and provides the publication date in parentheses after the author’s name. The page number appears in parentheses <strong class="emphasis bold">after</strong> the closing quotation marks and <strong class="emphasis bold">before</strong> the period that ends the sentence.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_n02">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p06">Addiction researchers caution that “junk food cannot be considered addictive in the same way that we think of psychoactive drugs as addictive” (Epstein, 2010, p. 137).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p07">Here, the writer provides a parenthetical citation at the end of the sentence that includes the author’s name, the year of publication, and the page number separated by commas. Again, the parenthetical citation is placed <strong class="emphasis bold">after</strong> the closing quotation marks and <strong class="emphasis bold">before</strong> the period at the end of the sentence.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_n03">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p08">As noted in the book <em class="emphasis">Junk Food, Junk Science</em> (Epstein, 2010, p. 137), “junk food cannot be considered addictive in the same way that we think of psychoactive drugs as addictive.”</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p09">Here, the writer chose to mention the source title in the sentence (an optional piece of information to include) and followed the title with a parenthetical citation. Note that the parenthetical citation is placed <strong class="emphasis bold">before</strong> the comma that signals the end of the introductory phrase.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_n04">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p10">David Epstein’s book <em class="emphasis">Junk Food, Junk Science</em> (2010) pointed out that “junk food cannot be considered addictive in the same way that we think of psychoactive drugs as addictive” (p. 137).</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p11">Another variation is to introduce the author and the source title in your sentence and include the publication date and page number in parentheses within the sentence or at the end of the sentence. As long as you have included the essential information, you can choose the option that works best for that particular sentence and source.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p12">Citing a book with a single author is usually a straightforward task. Of course, your research may require that you cite many other types of sources, such as books or articles with more than one author or sources with no individual author listed. You may also need to cite sources available in both print and online and nonprint sources, such as websites and personal interviews. <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13#fresh-ch13">Chapter 13 "APA and MLA Documentation and Formatting"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13_s02#fresh-ch13_s02">Section 13.2 "Citing and Referencing Techniques"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13_s03#fresh-ch13_s03">Section 13.3 "Creating a References Section"</a> provide extensive guidelines for citing a variety of source types.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p13">APA is just one of several different styles with its own guidelines for documentation, formatting, and language usage. Depending on your field of interest, you may be exposed to additional styles, such as the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">MLA style.</strong> Determined by the Modern Languages Association and used for papers in literature, languages, and other disciplines in the humanities.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Chicago style.</strong> Outlined in the <em class="emphasis">Chicago Manual of Style</em> and sometimes used for papers in the humanities and the sciences; many professional organizations use this style for publications as well.</li>
                    <li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s02_p01">The brief citations included in the body of your paper correspond to the more detailed citations provided at the end of the paper in the references section. In-text citations provide basic information—the author’s name, the publication date, and the page number if necessary—while the references section provides more extensive bibliographical information. Again, this information allows your reader to follow up on the sources you cited and do additional reading about the topic if desired.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s02_p02">The specific format of entries in the list of references varies slightly for different source types, but the entries generally include the following information:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>The name(s) of the author(s) or institution that wrote the source</li>
                <li>The year of publication and, where applicable, the exact date of publication</li>
                <li>The full title of the source</li>
                <li>For books, the city of publication</li>
                <li>For articles or essays, the name of the periodical or book in which the article or essay appears</li>
                <li>For magazine and journal articles, the volume number, issue number, and pages where the article appears</li>
                <li>For sources on the web, the URL where the source is located</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s02_p03">The references page is double spaced and lists entries in alphabetical order by the author’s last name. If an entry continues for more than one line, the second line and each subsequent line are indented five spaces. Review the following example. (<a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13#fresh-ch13">Chapter 13 "APA and MLA Documentation and Formatting"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13_s03#fresh-ch13_s03">Section 13.3 "Creating a References Section"</a> provides extensive guidelines for formatting reference entries for different types of sources.)</p>
