Sometimes writers use modifiers incorrectly, leading to strange and unintentionally humorous sentences. The two common types of modifier errors are called misplaced modifiers and dangling modifiers. If either of these errors occurs, readers can no longer read smoothly. Instead, they become stumped trying to figure out <em class="emphasis">what</em> the writer meant to say. A writer’s goal must always be to communicate clearly and to avoid distracting the reader with strange sentences or awkward sentence constructions. The good news is that these errors can be easily overcome.</p>

                <li>
                    <p class="para">Look for an <em class="emphasis">-ing</em> modifier at the beginning of your sentence or another modifying phrase:</p>
