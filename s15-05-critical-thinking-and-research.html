    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_p01">At this point in your project, you are preparing to move from the research phase to the writing phase. You have gathered much of the information you will use, and soon you will be ready to begin writing your draft. This section helps you transition smoothly from one phase to the next.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_p02">Beginning writers sometimes attempt to transform a pile of note cards into a formal research paper without any intermediary step. This approach presents problems. The writer’s original question and thesis may be buried in a flood of disconnected details taken from research sources. The first draft may present redundant or contradictory information. Worst of all, the writer’s ideas and voice may be lost.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_p03">An effective research paper focuses on the writer’s ideas—from the question that sparked the research process to how the writer answers that question based on the research findings. Before beginning a draft, or even an outline, good writers pause and reflect. They ask themselves questions such as the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_l02">
        <li>How has my thinking changed based on my research? What have I learned?</li>
        <li>Was my working thesis on target? Do I need to rework my thesis based on what I have learned?</li>
        <li>How does the information in my sources mesh with my research questions and help me answer those questions? Have any additional important questions or subtopics come up that I will need to address in my paper?</li>
        <li>How do my sources complement each other? What ideas or facts recur in multiple sources?</li>
        <li>Where do my sources disagree with each other, and why?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_p04">In this section, you will reflect on your research and review the information you have gathered.

        <h3 class="title">Exercise 1</h3>
        <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s05_p05">Review the research questions and working thesis you developed in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11_s02#fresh-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Steps in Developing a Research Proposal"</a>. Set a timer for ten minutes and write about your topic, using your questions and thesis to guide your writing. Complete this exercise without looking over your notes or sources. Base your writing on the overall impressions and concepts you have absorbed while conducting research. If additional, related questions come to mind, jot them down.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Selecting Useful Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_p01">At this point in the research process, you have gathered information from a wide variety of sources. Now it is time to think about how you will use this information as a writer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_p02">When you conduct research, you keep an open mind and seek out many promising sources. You take notes on any information that looks like it might help you answer your research questions. Often, new ideas and terms come up in your reading, and these, too, find their way into your notes. You may record facts or quotations that catch your attention even if they did not seem immediately relevant to your research question. By now, you have probably amassed an impressively detailed collection of notes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_p03">You will not use all of your notes in your paper.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_p04">Good researchers are thorough. They look at multiple perspectives, facts, and ideas related to their topic, and they gather a great deal of information. Effective writers, however, are selective. They determine which information is most relevant and appropriate for their purpose. They include details that develop or explain their ideas—and they leave out details that do not. The writer, not the pile of notes, is the controlling force. The writer shapes the content of the research paper.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_p05">While working through <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11_s04#fresh-ch11_s04">Section 11.4 "Strategies for Gathering Reliable Information"</a>, you used strategies to filter out unreliable or irrelevant sources and details. Now you will apply your critical-thinking skills to the information you recorded—analyzing how it is relevant, determining how it meshes with your ideas, and finding how it forms connections and patterns.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_p06">When you create workplace documents based on research, selectivity remains important. A project team may spend months conducting market surveys to prepare for rolling out a new product, but few managers have time to read the research in its entirety. Most employees want the research distilled into a few well-supported points. Focused, concise writing is highly valued in the workplace.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Identify Information That Supports Your Thesis</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s01_p01">In <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch11_s05_n02">Note 11.81 "Exercise 1"</a>, you revisited your research questions and working thesis. The process of writing informally helped you see how you might begin to pull together what you have learned from your research. Do not feel anxious, however, if you still have trouble seeing the big picture. Systematically looking through your notes will help you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s01_p02">Begin by identifying the notes that clearly support your thesis. Mark or group these, either physically or using the cut-and-paste function in your word-processing program. As you identify the crucial details that support your thesis, make sure you analyze them critically. Ask the following questions to focus your thinking:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Is this detail from a reliable, high-quality source? Is it appropriate for me to cite this source in an academic paper?</strong> The bulk of the support for your thesis should come from reliable, reputable sources. If most of the details that support your thesis are from less-reliable sources, you may need to do additional research or modify your thesis.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Is the link between this information and my thesis obvious—or will I need to explain it to my readers?</strong> Remember, you have spent more time thinking and reading about this topic than your audience. Some connections might be obvious to both you and your readers. More often, however, you will need to provide the analysis or explanation that shows how the information supports your thesis. As you read through your notes, jot down ideas you have for making those connections clear.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What personal biases or experiences might affect the way I interpret this information?</strong> No researcher is 100 percent objective. We all have personal opinions and experiences that influence our reactions to what we read and learn. Good researchers are aware of this human tendency. They keep an open mind when they read opinions or facts that contradict their beliefs.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s01_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s01_p03">It can be tempting to ignore information that does not support your thesis or that contradicts it outright. However, such information is important. At the very least, it gives you a sense of what has been written about the issue. More importantly, it can help you question and refine your own thinking so that writing your research paper is a true learning process.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Find Connections between Your Sources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p01">As you find connections between your ideas and information in your sources, also look for information that connects your sources. Do most sources seem to agree on a particular idea? Are some facts mentioned repeatedly in many different sources? What key terms or major concepts come up in most of your sources regardless of whether the sources agree on the finer points? Identifying these connections will help you identify important ideas to discuss in your paper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p02">Look for subtler ways your sources complement one another, too. Does one author refer to another’s book or article? How do sources that are more recent build upon the ideas developed in earlier sources?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p03">Be aware of any redundancies in your sources. If you have amassed solid support from a reputable source, such as a scholarly journal, there is no need to cite the same facts from an online encyclopedia article that is many steps removed from any primary research. If a given source adds nothing new to your discussion and you can cite a stronger source for the same information, use the stronger source.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p04">Determine how you will address any contradictions found among different sources. For instance, if one source cites a startling fact that you cannot confirm anywhere else, it is safe to dismiss the information as unreliable. However, if you find significant disagreements among reliable sources, you will need to review them and evaluate each source. Which source presents a sounder argument or more solid evidence? It is up to you to determine which source is the most credible and why.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p05">Finally, do not ignore any information simply because it does not support your thesis. Carefully consider how that information fits into the big picture of your research. You may decide that the source is unreliable or the information is not relevant, or you may decide that it is an important point you need to bring up. What matters is that you give it careful consideration.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p06">As Jorge reviewed his research, he realized that some of the information was not especially useful for his purpose. His notes included several statements about the relationship between soft drinks that are high in sugar and childhood obesity—a subtopic that was too far outside of the main focus of the paper. Jorge decided to cut this material.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reevaluate Your Working Thesis</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s03_p01">A careful analysis of your notes will help you reevaluate your working thesis and determine whether you need to revise it. Remember that your working thesis was the starting point—not necessarily the end point—of your research. You should revise your working thesis if your ideas changed based on what you read. Even if your sources generally confirmed your preliminary thinking on the topic, it is still a good idea to tweak the wording of your thesis to incorporate the specific details you learned from research.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s03_p02">Jorge realized that his working thesis oversimplified the issues. He still believed that the media was exaggerating the benefits of low-carb diets. However, his research led him to conclude that these diets did have some advantages. Read Jorge’s revised thesis.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Synthesizing and Organizing Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_p01">By now your thinking on your topic is taking shape. You have a sense of what major ideas to address in your paper, what points you can easily support, and what questions or subtopics might need a little more thought. In short, you have begun the process of synthesizing information—that is, of putting the pieces together into a coherent whole.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_p02">It is normal to find this part of the process a little difficult. Some questions or concepts may still be unclear to you. You may not yet know how you will tie all of your research together. Synthesizing information is a complex, demanding mental task, and even experienced researchers struggle with it at times. A little uncertainty is often a good sign! It means you are challenging yourself to work thoughtfully with your topic instead of simply restating the same information.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Use Your Research Questions to Synthesize Information</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p01">You have already considered how your notes fit with your working thesis. Now, take your synthesis a step further. Analyze how your notes relate to your major research question and the subquestions you identified in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11_s02#fresh-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Steps in Developing a Research Proposal"</a>. Organize your notes with headings that correspond to those questions. As you proceed, you might identify some important subtopics that were not part of your original plan, or you might decide that some questions are not relevant to your paper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p02">Categorize information carefully and continue to think critically about the material. Ask yourself whether the sources are reliable and whether the connections between ideas are clear.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p03">Remember, your ideas and conclusions will shape the paper. They are the glue that holds the rest of the content together. As you work, begin jotting down the big ideas you will use to connect the dots for your reader. (If you are not sure where to begin, try answering your major research question and subquestions. Add and answer new questions as appropriate.) You might record these big ideas on sticky notes or type and highlight them within an electronic document.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p04">Jorge looked back on the list of research questions that he had written down earlier. He changed a few to match his new thesis, and he began a rough outline for his paper.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p07">Some paragraphs in your paper will consist mostly of details from your research. That is fine, as long as you explain what those details mean or how they are linked. You should also include sentences and transitions that show the relationship between different facts from your research by grouping related ideas or pointing out connections or contrasts. The result is that you are not simply presenting information; you are synthesizing, analyzing, and interpreting it.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s02_p01">The final step to complete before beginning your draft is to choose an organizational structure. For some assignments, this may be determined by the instructor’s requirements. For instance, if you are asked to explore the impact of a new communications device, a cause-and-effect structure is obviously appropriate. In other cases, you will need to determine the structure based on what suits your topic and purpose.
