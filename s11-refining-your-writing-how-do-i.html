    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_p01">Have you ever ordered a dish in a restaurant and been not happy with its taste, even though it contained most of your favorite ingredients? Just as a meal might lack the finishing touches needed to spice it up, so too might a paragraph contain all the basic components but still lack the stylistic finesse required to engage a reader. Sometimes writers have a tendency to reuse the same sentence pattern throughout their writing. Like any repetitive task, reading text that contains too many sentences with the same length and structure can become monotonous and boring. Experienced writers mix it up by using an assortment of sentence patterns, rhythms, and lengths.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_p02">In this chapter, you will follow a student named Naomi who has written a draft of an essay but needs to refine her writing. This section discusses how to introduce sentence variety into writing, how to open sentences using a variety of techniques, and how to use different types of sentence structure when connecting ideas. You can use these techniques when revising a paper to bring life and rhythm to your work. They will also make reading your work more enjoyable.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Incorporating Sentence Variety</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p01">Experienced writers incorporate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sentence variety</a><span class="glossdef">Use of an assortment of sentence patterns, rhythms, and lengths to reduce repetition and emphasize important points in a text.</span></span> into their writing by varying sentence style and structure. Using a mixture of different sentence structures reduces repetition and adds emphasis to important points in the text. Read the following example:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p02">During my time in office I have achieved several goals. I have helped increase funding for local schools. I have reduced crime rates in the neighborhood. I have encouraged young people to get involved in their community. My competitor argues that she is the better choice in the upcoming election. I argue that it is ridiculous to fix something that isn’t broken. If you reelect me this year, I promise to continue to serve this community.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p03">In this extract from an election campaign, the writer uses short, simple sentences of a similar length and style. Writers often mistakenly believe that this technique makes the text more clear for the reader, but the result is a choppy, unsophisticated paragraph that does not grab the audience’s attention. Now read the revised paragraph with sentence variety:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p04">During my time in office, I have helped increase funding for local schools, reduced crime rates in the neighborhood, and encouraged young people to get involved in their community. Why fix what isn’t broken? If you reelect me this year, I will continue to achieve great things for this community. Don’t take a chance on an unknown contender; vote for the proven success.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p05">Notice how introducing a short rhetorical question among the longer sentences in the paragraph is an effective means of keeping the reader’s attention. In the revised version, the writer combines the choppy sentences at the beginning into one longer sentence, which adds rhythm and interest to the paragraph.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p06">Effective writers often implement the “rule of three,” which is basically the thought that things that contain three elements are more memorable and more satisfying to readers than any other number. Try to use a series of three when providing examples, grouping adjectives, or generating a list.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Using Sentence Variety at the Beginning of Sentences</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p01">Read the following sentences and consider what they all have in common:</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_n01">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p02">John and Amanda will be analyzing this week’s financial report.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p03">The car screeched to a halt just a few inches away from the young boy.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p05">If you are having trouble figuring out why these sentences are similar, try underlining the subject in each. You will notice that the subject is positioned at the beginning of each sentence—<em class="emphasis">John and Amanda</em>, <em class="emphasis">the car</em>, <em class="emphasis">students</em>. Since the subject-verb-object pattern is the simplest sentence structure, many writers tend to overuse this technique, which can result in repetitive paragraphs with little sentence variety.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Starting a Sentence with an Adverb</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">One technique you can use so as to avoid beginning a sentence with the subject is to use an adverb. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adverb</a><span class="glossdef">A word that describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb and often ends in <em class="emphasis">-ly</em>.</span></span> is a word that describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb and often ends in -<em class="emphasis">ly</em>. Examples of adverbs include <em class="emphasis">quickly</em>, <em class="emphasis">softly</em>, <em class="emphasis">quietly</em>, <em class="emphasis">angrily</em>, and <em class="emphasis">timidly</em>. Read the following sentences:</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_n01">
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">She slowly turned the corner and peered into the murky basement.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p03">Slowly, she turned the corner and peered into the murky basement.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p04">In the second sentence, the adverb <em class="emphasis">slowly</em> is placed at the beginning of the sentence. If you read the two sentences aloud, you will notice that moving the adverb changes the rhythm of the sentence and slightly alters its meaning. The second sentence emphasizes how the subject moves—slowly—creating a buildup of tension. This technique is effective in fictional writing.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p05">Note that an adverb used at the beginning of a sentence is usually followed by a comma. A comma indicates that the reader should pause briefly, which creates a useful rhetorical device. Read the following sentences aloud and consider the effect of pausing after the adverb:</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_n02">
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p06">Cautiously, he unlocked the kennel and waited for the dog’s reaction.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p07">Solemnly, the policeman approached the mayor and placed him under arrest.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s02_p27">The overuse of prepositional phrases often occurs when our thoughts are jumbled and we are unsure how concepts or ideas relate to one another. If you are preparing a report or a proposal, take the time to organize your thoughts in an outline before writing a rough draft. Read the draft aloud, either to yourself or to a colleague, and identify areas that are rambling or unclear. If you notice that a particular part of your report contains several sentences over twenty words, you should double check that particular section to make certain that it is coherent and does not contain unnecessary prepositional phrases. Reading aloud sometimes helps detect unclear and wordy sentences. You can also ask a colleague to paraphrase your main points to ensure that the meaning is clear.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s02_s04_p01">Another technique that writers use to combine sentences is to join them using a relative clause. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relative clause</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that contains a subject and a verb and describes a noun. A relative clause functions as an adjective in a sentence.</span></span> is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and describes a noun. Relative clauses function as adjectives by answering questions such as <em class="emphasis">which one?</em> or <em class="emphasis">what kind?</em> Relative clauses begin with a relative pronoun, such as <em class="emphasis">who</em>, <em class="emphasis">which</em>, <em class="emphasis">where</em>, <em class="emphasis">why</em>, or <em class="emphasis">when</em>. Read the following examples:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s02_s04_p04">To connect two sentences using a relative clause, substitute the subject of one of the sentences (<em class="emphasis">he</em>) for a relative pronoun (<em class="emphasis">who</em>). This gives you a relative clause (<em class="emphasis">who lives in Seattle</em>) that can be placed next to the noun it describes (<em class="emphasis">the managing director</em>). Make sure to keep the sentence you want to emphasize as the main clause. For example, reversing the main clause and subordinate clause in the preceding sentence emphasizes where the managing director lives, not the fact that he is visiting the company.</p>

An appositive may be placed anywhere in a sentence, but it must come directly before or after the noun to which it refers:</p>

Most sentences are declarative, but a carefully placed question, exclamation, or command can pique colleagues’ interest, even if the subject material is fairly dry. Imagine that you are writing a budget analysis. Beginning your report with a rhetorical question, such as “Where is our money going?” or “How can we increase sales?” encourages people to continue reading to find out the answers. Although they should be used sparingly in academic and professional writing, questions or commands are effective rhetorical devices.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p11">When writing an essay or a report, it is important that you do not use excessive coordination. Workplace documents should be clear and concise, so only join two clauses that are logically connected and can work together to make one main point. If you repeat the same coordinating conjunction several times in a sentence, you are probably including more than one idea. This may make it difficult for readers to pick out the most important information in each sentence.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s02_s02_p01">Subordination joins two sentences with related ideas by merging them into a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">main clause</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that contain a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete thought.</span></span> (a complete sentence) and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dependent clause</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that contain a subject and verb but cannot stand alone as a complete thought.</span></span> (a construction that relies on the main clause to complete its meaning). Coordination allows a writer to give equal weight to the two ideas that are being combined, and subordination enables a writer to emphasize one idea over the other. Take a look at the following sentences:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_p01">Earlier in this chapter, we learned that increasing sentence variety adds interest to a piece of writing and makes the reading process more enjoyable for others. Using a mixture of sentence lengths and patterns throughout an essay is an important writing technique. However, it is equally important to avoid introducing variation within individual sentences. A strong sentence is composed of balanced parts that all have the same structure. In this section, we will examine how to create a balanced sentence structure by using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parallelism</a><span class="glossdef">Using the same grammatical structure to express equal ideas in a sentence. Parallelism may occur at the word, phrase, or clause level.</span></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Parallelism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p01">Parallelism is the use of similar structure in related words, clauses, or phrases. It creates a sense of rhythm and balance within a sentence. As readers, we often correct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">faulty parallelism</a><span class="glossdef">A failure to create grammatically parallel structures in a sentence.</span></span>—a lack of parallel structure—intuitively because an unbalanced sentence sounds awkward and poorly constructed. Read the following sentences aloud:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> Kelly had to iron, do the washing, and shopping before her parents arrived.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> Driving a car requires coordination, patience, and to have good eyesight.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> Ali prefers jeans to wearing a suit.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p05">All of these sentences contain faulty parallelism. Although they are factually correct, the construction is clunky and confusing. In the first example, three different verb forms are used. In the second and third examples, the writer begins each sentence by using a noun (<em class="emphasis">coordination</em>, <em class="emphasis">jeans</em>), but ends with a phrase (<em class="emphasis">to have good eyesight</em>, <em class="emphasis">wearing a suit</em>). Now read the same three sentences that have correct parallelism.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Correct parallelism:</strong> Kelly had to do the ironing, washing, and shopping before her parents arrived.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p09">When these sentences are written using a parallel structure, they sound more aesthetically pleasing because they are balanced. Repetition of grammatical construction also minimizes the amount of work the reader has to do to decode the sentence. This enables the reader to focus on the main idea in the sentence and not on how the sentence is put together.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p10">A simple way to check for parallelism in your writing is to make sure you have paired nouns with nouns, verbs with verbs, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases, and so on. Underline each element in a sentence and check that the corresponding element uses the same grammatical form.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p01">When you are making a comparison, the two items being compared should have a parallel structure. Comparing two items without using parallel structure can lead to confusion about what is being compared.

In the second sentence, the writer uses the same grammatical construction to create a parallel structure. This clarifies that an action is being compared with another action.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p05">To correct some instances of faulty parallelism, it may be necessary to add or delete words in a sentence.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Group activity.</strong> Choose a well-known speech, such as Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, Winston Churchill’s “Blood, Toil, Tears, and Sweat” speech, or Barack Obama’s inaugural address. Make a copy of the speech and, as a group, underline examples of parallelism. Discuss the effects of using parallelism and consider whether it is always used to achieve the same result or whether the writer manipulates parallelism to create a variety of responses among his or her audience.</li>

Use the techniques you have learned throughout this chapter to edit your writing for sentence variety, appropriate coordination and subordination, and parallelism. When you have finished, compare the two versions and write a brief analysis of how sentence variety, coordination and subordination, and parallelism help refine a piece of writing.</p>
