    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s01_p01">If your first language is not English, you will most likely need some extra help when writing in Standard, or formal, English. New students of Standard English often make similar kinds of errors. Even if you have been speaking English for a long time, you may not feel as confident in your written English skills. This chapter covers the most common errors made by English language learners and helps you avoid similar mistakes in your writing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Basic Sentence Structures</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s01_s01_p01">The most basic sentence structure in English is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subject</a><span class="glossdef">A word that tells what the sentence is about. Subjects are usually nouns or pronouns.</span></span> plus a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">verb</a><span class="glossdef">A word that tells what the subject is doing or links the subject to a describing word.</span></span>. A subject performs the action in the sentence, and the verb identifies the action. Keep in mind that in some languages, such as Spanish and Italian, an obvious subject does not always perform the action in a sentence; the subject is often implied by the verb. However, every sentence in English must have a subject and a verb to express a complete thought.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Not all sentences are as simple as a subject plus a verb. To form more complex sentences, writers build upon this basic structure. Adding a prepositional phrase to the basic sentence creates a more complex sentence. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">preposition</a><span class="glossdef">Type of word that connects a noun, pronoun, or verb to another word that describes or modifies it. Common prepositions include <em class="emphasis">in</em>, <em class="emphasis">on</em>, <em class="emphasis">under</em>, <em class="emphasis">near</em>, <em class="emphasis">by</em>, <em class="emphasis">with</em>, and <em class="emphasis">about</em>.</span></span> is a part of speech that relates a noun or a pronoun to another word in a sentence. It also introduces a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prepositional phrase</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that begins with a preposition.</span></span>. If you can identify a preposition, you will be able to identify a prepositional phrase.</p>

                <li>The most basic sentence structure is a subject plus a verb that expresses a complete thought.</li>
                <li>Adding a prepositional phrase or a direct or indirect object to a sentence makes it more complex.</li>
                <li>English speakers change a sentence into a question in one of the following two ways: moving the helping verb and adding a question mark or adding the verb <em class="emphasis">do</em>, <em class="emphasis">does</em>, or <em class="emphasis">did</em> and adding a question mark.</li>
                <li>Adjectives follow a particular order before the noun they describe. The order is opinion, size, shape, age, color, ethnicity, and material.</li>
