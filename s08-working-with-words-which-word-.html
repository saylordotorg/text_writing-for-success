    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_p01">Just as a mason uses bricks to build sturdy homes, writers use words to build successful documents. Consider the construction of a building. Builders need to use tough, reliable materials to build a solid and structurally sound skyscraper. From the foundation to the roof and every floor in between, every part is necessary. Writers need to use strong, meaningful words from the first sentence to the last and in every sentence in between.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_p02">You already know many words that you use everyday as part of your writing and speaking <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vocabulary</a><span class="glossdef">A collection of spoken and written words used by individuals or groups.</span></span>. You probably also know that certain words fit better in certain situations. Letters, e-mails, and even quickly jotted grocery lists require the proper selection of vocabulary. Imagine you are writing a grocery list to purchase the ingredients for a recipe but accidentally write down cilantro when the recipe calls for parsley. Even though cilantro and parsley look remarkably alike, each produces a very different effect in food. This seemingly small error could radically alter the flavor of your dish!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_p03">Having a solid everyday vocabulary will help you while writing, but learning new words and avoiding common word errors will make a real impression on your readers. Experienced writers know that deliberate, careful word selection and usage can lead to more polished, more meaningful work. This chapter covers word choice and vocabulary-building strategies that will improve your writing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Commonly Confused Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Some words in English cause trouble for speakers and writers because these words share a similar pronunciation, meaning, or spelling with another word. These words are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commonly confused words</a><span class="glossdef">Words that share a similar pronunciation, meaning, or spelling.</span></span>. For example, read aloud the following sentences containing the commonly confused words <em class="emphasis">new</em> and <em class="emphasis">knew</em>:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_p02">I liked her <em class="emphasis">new</em> sweater.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_p04">These words may sound alike when spoken, but they carry entirely different usages and meanings. <em class="emphasis">New</em> is an adjective that describes the sweater, and <em class="emphasis">knew</em> is the past tense of the verb <em class="emphasis">to know</em>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s02_p02">For example, if the spell checker highlights a word that is misspelled and gives you a list of alternative words, you may choose a word that you never intended even though it is spelled correctly. This can change the meaning of your sentence. It can also confuse readers, making them lose interest. Computer spell checkers are useful editing tools, but they can never replace human knowledge of spelling rules, homonyms, and commonly misspelled words.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s01_p01">The best way to master new words is to understand the key spelling rules. Keep in mind, however, that some spelling rules carry exceptions. A spell checker may catch these exceptions, but knowing them yourself will prepare you to spell accurately on the first try. You may want to try memorizing each rule and its exception like you would memorize a rhyme or lyrics to a song.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s01_p11">Sherman J. Alexie Jr. was born in October 1966. He is a Spokane/Coeur dâAlene Indian and an American writer, poet, and filmmaker. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, or water on the brain. This condition led doctors to predict that he would likly suffer long-term brain damage and possibly mental retardation. Although Alexie survived with no mental disabilitys, he did suffer other serious side effects from his condition that plagud him throughout his childhood. Amazingly, Alexie learned to read by the age of three, and by age five he had read novels such as John Steinbeckâs <em class="emphasis">The Grapes of Wrath</em>. Raised on an Indian reservation, Alexie often felt aleinated from his peers due to his avid love for reading and also from the long-term effects of his illness, which often kept him from socializeing with his peers on the reservation. The reading skills he displaid at such a young age foreshadowed what he would later become. Today Alexie is a prolific and successful writer with several story anthologeis to his credit, noteably <em class="emphasis">The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Toughest Indian in the World</em>. Most of his fiction is about contemporary Native Americans who are influenced by pop culture and pow wows and everything in between. His work is sometimes funny but always thoughtful and full of richness and depth. Alexie also writes poetry, novels, and screenplays. His latest collection of storys is called <em class="emphasis">War Dances</em>, which came out in 2009.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Eight Tips to Improve Spelling Skills</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s01_l08">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read the words in your assignment carefully, and avoid skimming over the page.</strong> Focusing on your written assignment word by word will help you pay close attention to each wordâs spelling. Skimming quickly, you may overlook misspelled words.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use mnemonic devices to remember the correct spelling of words.</strong> Mnemonic devices, or memory techniques and learning aids, include inventive sayings or practices that help you remember. For example, the saying âIt is important to be a beautiful person inside and outâ may help you remember that <em class="emphasis">beautiful</em> begins with âbe a.â The practice of pronouncing the word <em class="emphasis">Wednesday</em> Wed-nes-day may help you remember how to spell the word correctly.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use a dictionary.</strong> Many professional writers rely on the dictionaryâeither in print or online. If you find it difficult to use a regular dictionary, ask your instructor to help you find a âpoor spellerâs dictionary.â</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use your computerâs spell checker.</strong> The spell checker will not solve all your spelling problems, but it is a useful tool. See the introduction to this section for cautions about spell checkers.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep a list of frequently misspelled words.</strong> You will often misspell the same words again and again, but do not let this discourage you. All writers struggle with the spellings of certain words; they become aware of their spelling weaknesses and work to improve. Be aware of which words you commonly misspell, and you can add them to a list to learn to spell them correctly.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look over corrected papers for misspelled words.</strong> Add these words to your list and practice writing each word four to five times each. Writing teachers will especially notice which words you frequently misspell, and it will help you excel in your classes if they see your spelling improve.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Test yourself with flashcards.</strong> Sometimes the old-fashioned methods are best, and for spelling, this tried and true technique has worked for many students. You can work with a peer or alone.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Review the common spelling rules explained in this chapter.</strong> Take the necessary time to master the material; you may return to the rules in this chapter again and again, as needed.</li>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p03">Identify and correct the ten commonly misspelled words in the following paragraph.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p04">Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs that make up New York City. It is located on the eastern shore of Long Island directly accross the East River from the island of Manhattan. Its beginings stretch back to the sixteenth century when it was founded by the Dutch who originally called it âBreuckelen.â Immedietely after the Dutch settled Brooklyn, it came under British rule. However, neither the Dutch nor the British were Brooklynâs first inhabitants. When European settlers first arrived, Brooklyn was largely inhabited by the Lenapi, a collective name for several organized bands of Native American people who settled a large area of land that extended from upstate New York through the entire state of New Jersey. They are sometimes referred to as the Delaware Indians. Over time, the Lenapi succumbed to European diseases or conflicts between European settlers or other Native American enemies. Finalley they were pushed out of Brooklyn completely by the British.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p05">In 1776, Brooklyn was the site of the first importent battle of the American Revolution known as the Battle of Brooklyn. The colonists lost this battle, which was led by George Washington, but over the next two years they would win the war, kicking the British out of the colonies once and for all.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p06">By the end of the nineteenth century, Brooklyn grew to be a city in its own right. The completion of the Brooklyn Bridge was an ocasion for celebration; transportation and commerce between Brooklyn and Manhattan now became much easier. Eventually, in 1898, Brooklyn lost its seperate identity as an independent city and became one of five boroughs of New York City. However, in some peopleâs opinien, the intagration into New York City should have never happened; they though Brooklyn should have remained an independent city.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p08">In todayâs job market, writing e-mails has become a means by which many people find employment. E-mails to prospective employers require thoughtful word choice, accurate spelling, and perfect punctuation. Employersâ inboxes are inundated with countless e-mails daily. If even the subject line of an e-mail contains a spelling error, it will likely be overlooked and someone elseâs e-mail will take priority.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p09">The best thing to do after you proofread an e-mail to an employer and run the spell checker is to have an additional set of eyes go over it with you; one of your teachers may be able to read the e-mail and give you suggestions for improvement. Most colleges and universities have writing centers, which may also be able to assist you.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_p01">Effective writing involves making conscious choices with words. When you prepare to sit down to write your first draft, you likely have already completed some freewriting exercises, chosen your topic, developed your thesis statement, written an outline, and even selected your sources. When it is time to write your first draft, start to consider which words to use to best convey your ideas to the reader.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_p02">Some writers are picky about word choice as they start drafting. They may practice some specific strategies, such as using a dictionary and thesaurus, using words and phrases with proper connotations, and avoiding slang, clichÃ©s, and overly general words.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_p03">Once you understand these tricks of the trade, you can move ahead confidently in writing your assignment. Remember, the skill and accuracy of your word choice is a major factor in developing your writing style. Precise selection of your words will help you be more clearly understoodâin both writing and speaking.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using a Dictionary and Thesaurus</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p01">Even professional writers need help with the meanings, spellings, pronunciations, and uses of particular words. In fact, they rely on dictionaries to help them write better. No one knows every word in the English language and their multiple uses and meanings, so all writers, from novices to professionals, can benefit from the use of dictionaries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p02">Most dictionaries provide the following information:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Spelling.</strong> How the word and its different forms are spelled.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pronunciation.</strong> How to say the word.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Part of speech.</strong> The function of the word.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Definition.</strong> The meaning of the word.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Synonyms.</strong> Words that have similar meanings.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Etymology.</strong> The history of the word.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p03">Look at the following sample dictionary entry and see which of the preceeding information you can identify:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">myth</strong>, mith, <em class="emphasis">n.</em> [Gr. <em class="emphasis">mythos</em>, a word, a fable, a legend.] A fable or legend embodying the convictions of a people as to their gods or other divine beings, their own beginnings and early history and the heroes connected with it, or the origin of the world; any invented story; something or someone having no existence in fact.â<strong class="emphasis bold">myth â¢ ic</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">myth â¢ i â¢ cal</strong></p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p05">Like a dictionary, a thesaurus is another indispensable writing tool. A thesaurus gives you a list of synonyms, words that have the same (or very close to the same) meaning as another word. It also lists antonyms, words with the opposite meaning of the word. A thesaurus will help you when you are looking for the perfect word with just the right meaning to convey your ideas. It will also help you learn more words and use the ones you already know more correctly.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_p01">As you work with your draft, you will want to pay particular attention to the words you have chosen. Do they express exactly what you are trying to convey? Can you choose better, more effective words? Familiarity with synonyms and antonyms can be helpful in answering these questions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Synonyms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Synonyms</a><span class="glossdef">Words that have the same, or almost the same, meaning as another word.</span></span> are words that have the same, or almost the same, meaning as another word. You can say an âeasy taskâ or a âsimple taskâ because <em class="emphasis">easy</em> and <em class="emphasis">simple</em> are synonyms. You can say Hong Kong is a âlarge cityâ or a âmetropolisâ because <em class="emphasis">city</em> and <em class="emphasis">metropolis</em> are synonyms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p02">However, it is important to remember that not all pairs of words in the English language are so easily interchangeable. The slight but important differences in meaning between synonyms can make a big difference in your writing. For example, the words <em class="emphasis">boring</em> and <em class="emphasis">insipid</em> may have similar meanings, but the subtle differences between the two will affect the message your writing conveys. The word <em class="emphasis">insipid</em> evokes a scholarly and perhaps more pretentious message than <em class="emphasis">boring</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p03">The English language is full of pairs of words that have subtle distinctions between them. All writers, professionals and beginners alike, face the challenge of choosing the most appropriate synonym to best convey their ideas. When you pay particular attention to synonyms in your writing, it comes across to your reader. The sentences become much more clear and rich in meaning.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p04">Any writing you do at work involves a careful choice of words. For example, if you are writing an e-mail to your employer regarding your earnings, you can use the word <em class="emphasis">pay</em>, <em class="emphasis">salary</em>, or hourly <em class="emphasis">wage</em>. There are also other synonyms to choose from. Just keep in mind that the word you choose will have an effect on the reader, so you want to choose wisely to get the desired effect.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p06">When most people think of the Renaissance, they might think of artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, or Leonardo da Vinci, but they often overlook one of the <span class="token">very important</span> figures of the Renaissance: Filippo Brunelleschi. Brunelleschi was born in Florence, Italy in 1377. He is considered the <span class="token">very best</span> architect and engineer of the Renaissance. His <span class="token">impressive</span> accomplishments are a testament to following oneâs dreams, persevering in the face of obstacles, and realizing oneâs vision.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p07">The most difficult undertaking of Brunelleschiâs career was the dome of Florence Cathedral, which took sixteen years to construct. A major blow to the progress of the construction happened in 1428. Brunelleschi had designed a special ship to carry the one hundred tons of marble needed for the dome. He felt this would be the <span class="token">most inexpensive</span> way to transport the marble, but the unthinkable happened. The ship <span class="token">went down to the bottom of the water</span>, taking all the marble with it to the bottom of the river. Brunelleschi was <span class="token">really sad</span>. Nevertheless, he did not give up. He held true to his vision of the completed dome. Filippo Brunelleschi completed construction of the dome of Florence Cathedral in 1446. His influence on artists and architects alike was felt strongly during his lifetime and can still be felt <span class="token">in this day and age</span>.</p>

Since most of your knowledge of vocabulary comes from reading, it is important that you recognize context clues. By becoming more aware of particular words and phrases surrounding a difficult word, you can make logical guesses about its meaning. The following are the different types of context clues:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_l02">
        <li>Brief definition or restatement</li>
        <li>Synonyms and antonyms</li>

    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Brief Definition or Restatement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p01">Sometimes a text directly states the definition or a restatement of the unknown word. The brief definition or restatement is signaled by a word or a punctuation mark. Consider the following example:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p02">If you visit Alaska, you will likely see many glaciers, or slow moving masses of ice.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p03">In this sentence, the word <em class="emphasis">glaciers</em> is defined by the phrase that follows the signal word <em class="emphasis">or</em>, which is <em class="emphasis">slow moving masses of ice</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p04">In other instances, the text may restate the meaning of the word in a different way, by using punctuation as a signal. Look at the following example:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p05">Marina was indignantâfuming madâwhen she discovered her brother had left for the party without her.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p06">Although <em class="emphasis">fuming mad</em> is not a formal definition of the word <em class="emphasis">indignant</em>, it does serve to define it. These two examples use signalsâthe word <em class="emphasis">or</em> and the punctuation dashesâto indicate the meaning of the unfamiliar word. Other signals to look for are the words <em class="emphasis">is</em>, <em class="emphasis">as</em>, <em class="emphasis">means</em>, <em class="emphasis">known as</em>, and <em class="emphasis">refers to</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Synonyms and Antonyms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p01">Sometimes a text gives a synonym of the unknown word to signal the meaning of the unfamiliar word:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p02">When you interpret an image, you actively question and examine what the image connotes and suggests.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p03">In this sentence the word <em class="emphasis">suggests</em> is a synonym of the word <em class="emphasis">connotes</em>. The word <em class="emphasis">and</em> sometimes signals synonyms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p04">Likewise, the word <em class="emphasis">but</em> may signal a contrast, which can help you define a word by its antonym.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p05">I abhor clothes shopping, but I adore grocery shopping.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p06">The word <em class="emphasis">abhor</em> is contrasted with its opposite: <em class="emphasis">adore</em>. From this context, the reader can guess that <em class="emphasis">abhor</em> means to dislike greatly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Examples</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p01">Sometimes a text will give you an example of the word that sheds light on its meaning:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p02">I knew Markâs ailurophobia was in full force because he began trembling and stuttering when he saw my cat, Ludwig, slink out from under the bed.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p03">Although <em class="emphasis">ailurophobia</em> is an unknown word, the sentence gives an example of its effects. Based on this example, a reader could confidently surmise that the word means a fear of cats.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p04">Look for signal words like <em class="emphasis">such as</em>, <em class="emphasis">for instance</em>, and <em class="emphasis">for example</em>. These words signal that a wordâs meaning may be revealed through an example.</p>

I had always felt like a fish out of water, so during my sophomore year I was determined to fit in with the cool people. Man, was that an uphill battle. I donât even know why I tried, but hindsight is 20/20 I guess. The first thing I did was change the way I dressed. I went from wearing clothes I was comfortable in to wearing stuff that was so not me. Then I started wearing a ton of makeup, and my brother was all like, âWhat happened to your face?â Not only did my looks change, my personality changed a lot too. I started to act all stuck up and bossy with my friends, and they didnât know how to respond to this person that used to be me. Luckily, this phase didnât last more than a couple of months. I decided it was more fun to be me than to try to be someone else. I guess you canât fit a square peg in a round hole after all.</p>
