        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s03_s01_p01">At this stage in the writing process, you may already have begun setting up your references section. This section may consist of a single page for a brief research paper or may extend for many pages in professional journal articles. As you create this section of your paper, follow the guidelines provided here.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p01">To set up your references section, use the insert page break feature of your word-processing program to begin a new page. Note that the header and margins will be the same as in the body of your paper, and pagination continues from the body of your paper. (In other words, if you set up the body of your paper correctly, the correct header and page number should appear automatically in your references section.) See additional guidelines below.</p>

                    <li>Use hanging indentation for each entry. The first line should be flush with the left margin, while any lines that follow should be indented five spaces. Note that hanging indentation is the opposite of normal indenting rules for paragraphs.</li>
                    <li>List entries in alphabetical order by the author’s last name. For a work with multiple authors, use the last name of the first author listed.</li>

                    <li>For a work with no individual author(s), use the name of the organization that published the work or, if this is unavailable, the title of the work in place of the author’s name.</li>
