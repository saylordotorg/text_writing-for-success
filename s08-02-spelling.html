    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s02_p01">One essential aspect of good writing is accurate spelling. With computer spell checkers, spelling may seem simple, but these programs fail to catch every error. Spell checkers identify some errors, but writers still have to consider the flagged words and suggested replacements. Writers are still responsible for the errors that remain.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s02_p02">For example, if the spell checker highlights a word that is misspelled and gives you a list of alternative words, you may choose a word that you never intended even though it is spelled correctly. This can change the meaning of your sentence. It can also confuse readers, making them lose interest. Computer spell checkers are useful editing tools, but they can never replace human knowledge of spelling rules, homonyms, and commonly misspelled words.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Common Spelling Rules</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s01_p01">The best way to master new words is to understand the key spelling rules. Keep in mind, however, that some spelling rules carry exceptions. A spell checker may catch these exceptions, but knowing them yourself will prepare you to spell accurately on the first try. You may want to try memorizing each rule and its exception like you would memorize a rhyme or lyrics to a song.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s01_p11">Sherman J. Alexie Jr. was born in October 1966. He is a Spokane/Coeur d’Alene Indian and an American writer, poet, and filmmaker. Alexie was born with hydrocephalus, or water on the brain. This condition led doctors to predict that he would likly suffer long-term brain damage and possibly mental retardation. Although Alexie survived with no mental disabilitys, he did suffer other serious side effects from his condition that plagud him throughout his childhood. Amazingly, Alexie learned to read by the age of three, and by age five he had read novels such as John Steinbeck’s <em class="emphasis">The Grapes of Wrath</em>. Raised on an Indian reservation, Alexie often felt aleinated from his peers due to his avid love for reading and also from the long-term effects of his illness, which often kept him from socializeing with his peers on the reservation. The reading skills he displaid at such a young age foreshadowed what he would later become. Today Alexie is a prolific and successful writer with several story anthologeis to his credit, noteably <em class="emphasis">The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Toughest Indian in the World</em>. Most of his fiction is about contemporary Native Americans who are influenced by pop culture and pow wows and everything in between. His work is sometimes funny but always thoughtful and full of richness and depth. Alexie also writes poetry, novels, and screenplays. His latest collection of storys is called <em class="emphasis">War Dances</em>, which came out in 2009.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Eight Tips to Improve Spelling Skills</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s01_l08">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read the words in your assignment carefully, and avoid skimming over the page.</strong> Focusing on your written assignment word by word will help you pay close attention to each word’s spelling. Skimming quickly, you may overlook misspelled words.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use mnemonic devices to remember the correct spelling of words.</strong> Mnemonic devices, or memory techniques and learning aids, include inventive sayings or practices that help you remember. For example, the saying “It is important to be a beautiful person inside and out” may help you remember that <em class="emphasis">beautiful</em> begins with “be a.” The practice of pronouncing the word <em class="emphasis">Wednesday</em> Wed-nes-day may help you remember how to spell the word correctly.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use a dictionary.</strong> Many professional writers rely on the dictionary—either in print or online. If you find it difficult to use a regular dictionary, ask your instructor to help you find a “poor speller’s dictionary.”</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use your computer’s spell checker.</strong> The spell checker will not solve all your spelling problems, but it is a useful tool. See the introduction to this section for cautions about spell checkers.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep a list of frequently misspelled words.</strong> You will often misspell the same words again and again, but do not let this discourage you. All writers struggle with the spellings of certain words; they become aware of their spelling weaknesses and work to improve. Be aware of which words you commonly misspell, and you can add them to a list to learn to spell them correctly.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look over corrected papers for misspelled words.</strong> Add these words to your list and practice writing each word four to five times each. Writing teachers will especially notice which words you frequently misspell, and it will help you excel in your classes if they see your spelling improve.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Test yourself with flashcards.</strong> Sometimes the old-fashioned methods are best, and for spelling, this tried and true technique has worked for many students. You can work with a peer or alone.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Review the common spelling rules explained in this chapter.</strong> Take the necessary time to master the material; you may return to the rules in this chapter again and again, as needed.</li>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p03">Identify and correct the ten commonly misspelled words in the following paragraph.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p04">Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs that make up New York City. It is located on the eastern shore of Long Island directly accross the East River from the island of Manhattan. Its beginings stretch back to the sixteenth century when it was founded by the Dutch who originally called it “Breuckelen.” Immedietely after the Dutch settled Brooklyn, it came under British rule. However, neither the Dutch nor the British were Brooklyn’s first inhabitants. When European settlers first arrived, Brooklyn was largely inhabited by the Lenapi, a collective name for several organized bands of Native American people who settled a large area of land that extended from upstate New York through the entire state of New Jersey. They are sometimes referred to as the Delaware Indians. Over time, the Lenapi succumbed to European diseases or conflicts between European settlers or other Native American enemies. Finalley they were pushed out of Brooklyn completely by the British.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p05">In 1776, Brooklyn was the site of the first importent battle of the American Revolution known as the Battle of Brooklyn. The colonists lost this battle, which was led by George Washington, but over the next two years they would win the war, kicking the British out of the colonies once and for all.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p06">By the end of the nineteenth century, Brooklyn grew to be a city in its own right. The completion of the Brooklyn Bridge was an ocasion for celebration; transportation and commerce between Brooklyn and Manhattan now became much easier. Eventually, in 1898, Brooklyn lost its seperate identity as an independent city and became one of five boroughs of New York City. However, in some people’s opinien, the intagration into New York City should have never happened; they though Brooklyn should have remained an independent city.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p08">In today’s job market, writing e-mails has become a means by which many people find employment. E-mails to prospective employers require thoughtful word choice, accurate spelling, and perfect punctuation. Employers’ inboxes are inundated with countless e-mails daily. If even the subject line of an e-mail contains a spelling error, it will likely be overlooked and someone else’s e-mail will take priority.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p09">The best thing to do after you proofread an e-mail to an employer and run the spell checker is to have an additional set of eyes go over it with you; one of your teachers may be able to read the e-mail and give you suggestions for improvement.

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s02_s02_p10">What is your definition of a successful person? Is it based on a person’s profession or is it based on his or her character? Perhaps success means a combination of both. In one paragraph, describe in detail what you think makes a person successful. When you are finished, proofread your work for spelling errors. Exchange papers with a partner and read each other’s work. See if you catch any spelling errors that your partner missed.</p>
