    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p01">If you think that a blank sheet of paper or a blinking cursor on the computer screen is a scary sight, you are not alone. Many writers, students, and employees find that beginning to write can be intimidating. When faced with a blank page, however, experienced writers remind themselves that writing, like other everyday activities, is a process. Every process, from writing to cooking, bike riding, and learning to use a new cell phone, will get significantly easier with practice.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p02">Just as you need a recipe, ingredients, and proper tools to cook a delicious meal, you also need a plan, resources, and adequate time to create a good written composition. In other words, writing is a process that requires following steps and using strategies to accomplish your goals.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_n02">
        <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p03">These are the five steps in the writing process:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch08_s01_l02">
            <li>Prewriting</li>
            <li>Outlining the structure of ideas</li>
            <li>Writing a rough draft</li>
            <li>Revising</li>
            <li>Editing</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p04">Effective writing can be simply described as good ideas that are expressed well and arranged in the proper order. This chapter will give you the chance to work on all these important aspects of writing. Although many more prewriting strategies exist, this chapter covers six: using experience and observations, freewriting, asking questions, brainstorming, mapping, and searching the Internet. Using the strategies in this chapter can help you overcome the fear of the blank page and confidently begin the writing process.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Prewriting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Prewriting is the stage of the writing process during which you transfer your abstract thoughts into more concrete ideas in ink on paper (or in type on a computer screen). Although prewriting techniques can be helpful in all stages of the writing process, the following four strategies are best used when initially deciding on a topic:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Using experience and observations</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Freewriting</li>
            <li>Asking questions</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_p02">At this stage in the writing process, it is OK if you choose a general topic. Later you will learn more prewriting strategies that will narrow the focus of the topic.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing a Topic</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01">In addition to understanding that writing is a process, writers also understand that choosing a good general topic for an assignment is an essential step. Sometimes your instructor will give you an idea to begin an assignment, and other times your instructor will ask you to come up with a topic on your own. A good topic not only covers what an assignment will be about but also fits the assignment’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">purpose</a><span class="glossdef">The reason(s) why a writer creates a document.</span></span> and its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audience</a><span class="glossdef">The individual(s) or group(s) whom the writer intends to address.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p02">In this chapter, you will follow a writer named Mariah as she prepares a piece of writing. You will also be planning one of your own. The first important step is for you to tell yourself why you are writing (to inform, to explain, or some other purpose) and for whom you are writing. Write your purpose and your audience on your own sheet of paper, and keep the paper close by as you read and complete exercises in this chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p03">My purpose: ____________________________________________</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p04">My audience: ____________________________________________</p>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Using Experience and Observations</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">When selecting a topic, you may also want to consider something that interests you or something based on your own life and personal experiences. Even everyday observations can lead to interesting topics. After writers think about their experiences and observations, they often take notes on paper to better develop their thoughts. These notes help writers discover what they have to say about their topic.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">Have you seen an attention-grabbing story on your local news channel? Many current issues appear on television, in magazines, and on the Internet. These can all provide inspiration for your writing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Reading</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p01">Reading plays a vital role in all the stages of the writing process, but it first figures in the development of ideas and topics. Different kinds of documents can help you choose a topic and also develop that topic. For example, a magazine advertising the latest research on the threat of global warming may catch your eye in the supermarket. This cover may interest you, and you may consider global warming as a topic. Or maybe a novel’s courtroom drama sparks your curiosity of a particular lawsuit or legal controversy.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p02">After you choose a topic, critical reading is essential to the development of a topic. While reading almost any document, you evaluate the author’s point of view by thinking about his main idea and his support. When you judge the author’s argument, you discover more about not only the author’s opinion but also your own. If this step already seems daunting, remember that even the best writers need to use prewriting strategies to generate ideas.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_n01">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p03">The steps in the writing process may seem time consuming at first, but following these steps will save you time in the future. The more you plan in the beginning by reading and using prewriting strategies, the less time you may spend writing and editing later because your ideas will develop more swiftly.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p04">Prewriting strategies depend on your critical reading skills. Reading prewriting exercises (and outlines and drafts later in the writing process) will further develop your topic and ideas. As you continue to follow the writing process, you will see how Mariah uses critical reading skills to assess her own prewriting exercises.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Freewriting</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Freewriting</a><span class="glossdef">A prewriting strategy in which writers write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes).</span></span> is an exercise in which you write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes). During the time limit, you may jot down any thoughts that come to your mind. Try not to worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation. Instead, write as quickly as you can without stopping. If you get stuck, just copy the same word or phrase over and over until you come up with a new thought.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p02">Writing often comes easier when you have a personal connection with the topic you have chosen. Remember, to generate ideas in your freewriting, you may also think about readings that you have enjoyed or that have challenged your thinking. Doing this may lead your thoughts in interesting directions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p03">Quickly recording your thoughts on paper will help you discover what you have to say about a topic. When writing quickly, try not to doubt or question your ideas. Allow yourself to write freely and unselfconsciously. Once you start writing with few limitations, you may find you have more to say than you first realized. Your flow of thoughts can lead you to discover even more ideas about the topic. Freewriting may even lead you to discover another topic that excites you even more.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p04">Look at Mariah’s example. The instructor allowed the members of the class to choose their own topics, and Mariah thought about her experiences as a communications major. She used this freewriting exercise to help her generate more concrete ideas from her own experience.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_n01">

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p05">Some prewriting strategies can be used together. For example, you could use experience and observations to come up with a topic related to your course studies. Then you could use freewriting to describe your topic in more detail and figure out what you have to say about it.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Asking Questions</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p01">Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? In everyday situations, you pose these kinds of questions to get more information. Who will be my partner for the project? When is the next meeting? Why is my car making that odd noise? Even the title of this chapter begins with the question “How do I begin?”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p02">You seek the answers to these questions to gain knowledge, to better understand your daily experiences, and to plan for the future. Asking these types of questions will also help you with the writing process. As you choose your topic, answering these questions can help you revisit the ideas you already have and generate new ways to think about your topic. You may also discover aspects of the topic that are unfamiliar to you and that you would like to learn more about. All these idea-gathering techniques will help you plan for future work on your assignment.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p03">When Mariah reread her freewriting notes, she found she had rambled and her thoughts were disjointed. She realized that the topic that interested her most was the one she started with, the media. She then decided to explore that topic by asking herself questions about it. Her purpose was to refine media into a topic she felt comfortable writing about. To see how asking questions can help you choose a topic, take a look at the following chart that Mariah completed to record her questions and answers. She asked herself the questions that reporters and journalists use to gather information for their stories. The questions are often called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">5WH questions</a><span class="glossdef">The questions that reporters and journalists use to gather information for their stories and that writers use in the writing process: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?</span></span>, after their initial letters.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p04">Prewriting is very purpose driven; it does not follow a set of hard-and-fast rules. The purpose of prewriting is to find and explore ideas so that you will be prepared to write. A prewriting technique like asking questions can help you both find a topic and explore it. The key to effective prewriting is to use the techniques that work best for your thinking process. Freewriting may not seem to fit your thinking process, but keep an open mind. It may work better than you think. Perhaps brainstorming a list of topics might better fit your personal style. Mariah found freewriting and asking questions to be fruitful strategies to use. In your own prewriting, use the 5WH questions in any way that benefits your planning.</p>

Then read each question and use your own paper to answer the 5WH questions. As with Mariah when she explored her writing topic for more detail, it is OK if you do not know all the answers. If you do not know an answer, use your own opinion to speculate, or guess. You may also use factual information from books or articles you previously read on your topic. Later in the chapter, you will read about additional ways (like searching the Internet) to answer your questions and explore your guesses.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Brainstorming</li>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Narrowing the Focus</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p01">Narrowing the focus means breaking up the topic into subtopics, or more specific points. Generating lots of subtopics will help you eventually select the ones that fit the assignment and appeal to you and your audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p02">After rereading her syllabus, Mariah realized her general topic, mass media, is too broad for her class’s short paper requirement. Three pages are not enough to cover all the concerns in mass media today. Mariah also realized that although her readers are other communications majors who are interested in the topic, they may want to read a paper about a particular issue in mass media.</p>

Start with a blank sheet of paper (or a blank computer document) and write your general topic across the top. Underneath your topic, make a list of more specific ideas. Think of your general topic as a broad category and the list items as things that fit in that category. Often you will find that one item can lead to the next, creating a flow of ideas that can help you narrow your focus to a more specific paper topic.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s01_p02">The following is Mariah’s brainstorming list:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s01_p04">Imagine you have to write an e-mail to your current boss explaining your prior work experience, but you do not know where to start.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Idea mapping</a><span class="glossdef">A prewriting strategy in which writers cluster ideas on paper using circles, lines, and arrows.</span></span> allows you to visualize your ideas on paper using circles, lines, and arrows. This technique is also known as clustering because ideas are broken down and clustered, or grouped together. Many writers like this method because the shapes show how the ideas relate or connect, and writers can find a focused topic from the connections mapped. Using idea mapping, you might discover interesting connections between topics that you had not thought of before.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s02_p02">To create an idea map, start with your general topic in a circle in the center of a blank sheet of paper. Then write specific ideas around it and use lines or arrows to connect them together. Add and cluster as many ideas as you can think of.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s02_p03">In addition to brainstorming, Mariah tried idea mapping. Review the following idea map that Mariah created:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s02_p04">Notice Mariah’s largest circle contains her general topic, mass media. Then, the general topic branches into two subtopics written in two smaller circles: television and radio. The subtopic television branches into even more specific topics: cable and DVDs. From there, Mariah drew more circles and wrote more specific ideas: high definition and digital recording from cable and Blu-ray from DVDs. The radio topic led Mariah to draw connections between music, downloads versus CDs, and, finally, piracy.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s02_p05">From this idea map, Mariah saw she could consider narrowing the focus of her mass media topic to the more specific topic of music piracy.</p>

Reading legal jargon made Mariah uncomfortable with the results, so she decided to look further. Reviewing her map, she realized that she was more interested in consumer aspects of mass media, so she refocused her search to media technology and the sometimes confusing array of expensive products that fill electronics stores. Now, Mariah considers a paper topic on the products that have fed the mass media boom in everyday lives.</p>
