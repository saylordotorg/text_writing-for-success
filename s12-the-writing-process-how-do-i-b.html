    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p01">If you think that a blank sheet of paper or a blinking cursor on the computer screen is a scary sight, you are not alone. Many writers, students, and employees find that beginning to write can be intimidating. When faced with a blank page, however, experienced writers remind themselves that writing, like other everyday activities, is a process. Every process, from writing to cooking, bike riding, and learning to use a new cell phone, will get significantly easier with practice.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p02">Just as you need a recipe, ingredients, and proper tools to cook a delicious meal, you also need a plan, resources, and adequate time to create a good written composition. In other words, writing is a process that requires following steps and using strategies to accomplish your goals.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_n02">
        <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p03">These are the five steps in the writing process:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch08_s01_l02">
            <li>Prewriting</li>
            <li>Outlining the structure of ideas</li>

            <li>Revising</li>
            <li>Editing</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_p04">Effective writing can be simply described as good ideas that are expressed well and arranged in the proper order. This chapter will give you the chance to work on all these important aspects of writing. Although many more prewriting strategies exist, this chapter covers six: using experience and observations, freewriting, asking questions, brainstorming, mapping, and searching the Internet. Using the strategies in this chapter can help you overcome the fear of the blank page and confidently begin the writing process.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Prewriting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_p01">Prewriting is the stage of the writing process during which you transfer your abstract thoughts into more concrete ideas in ink on paper (or in type on a computer screen). Although prewriting techniques can be helpful in all stages of the writing process, the following four strategies are best used when initially deciding on a topic:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Using experience and observations</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Freewriting</li>
            <li>Asking questions</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_p02">At this stage in the writing process, it is OK if you choose a general topic. Later you will learn more prewriting strategies that will narrow the focus of the topic.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing a Topic</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p01">In addition to understanding that writing is a process, writers also understand that choosing a good general topic for an assignment is an essential step. Sometimes your instructor will give you an idea to begin an assignment, and other times your instructor will ask you to come up with a topic on your own. A good topic not only covers what an assignment will be about but also fits the assignment’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">purpose</a><span class="glossdef">The reason(s) why a writer creates a document.</span></span> and its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audience</a><span class="glossdef">The individual(s) or group(s) whom the writer intends to address.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p02">In this chapter, you will follow a writer named Mariah as she prepares a piece of writing. You will also be planning one of your own. The first important step is for you to tell yourself why you are writing (to inform, to explain, or some other purpose) and for whom you are writing. Write your purpose and your audience on your own sheet of paper, and keep the paper close by as you read and complete exercises in this chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p03">My purpose: ____________________________________________</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_p04">My audience: ____________________________________________</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Using Experience and Observations</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">When selecting a topic, you may also want to consider something that interests you or something based on your own life and personal experiences. Even everyday observations can lead to interesting topics. After writers think about their experiences and observations, they often take notes on paper to better develop their thoughts. These notes help writers discover what they have to say about their topic.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">Have you seen an attention-grabbing story on your local news channel? Many current issues appear on television, in magazines, and on the Internet. These can all provide inspiration for your writing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Reading</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p01">Reading plays a vital role in all the stages of the writing process, but it first figures in the development of ideas and topics. Different kinds of documents can help you choose a topic and also develop that topic. For example, a magazine advertising the latest research on the threat of global warming may catch your eye in the supermarket. This cover may interest you, and you may consider global warming as a topic. Or maybe a novel’s courtroom drama sparks your curiosity of a particular lawsuit or legal controversy.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p02">After you choose a topic, critical reading is essential to the development of a topic. While reading almost any document, you evaluate the author’s point of view by thinking about his main idea and his support. When you judge the author’s argument, you discover more about not only the author’s opinion but also your own. If this step already seems daunting, remember that even the best writers need to use prewriting strategies to generate ideas.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_n01">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p03">The steps in the writing process may seem time consuming at first, but following these steps will save you time in the future. The more you plan in the beginning by reading and using prewriting strategies, the less time you may spend writing and editing later because your ideas will develop more swiftly.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s02_p04">Prewriting strategies depend on your critical reading skills. Reading prewriting exercises (and outlines and drafts later in the writing process) will further develop your topic and ideas. As you continue to follow the writing process, you will see how Mariah uses critical reading skills to assess her own prewriting exercises.</p>

            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Freewriting</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Freewriting</a><span class="glossdef">A prewriting strategy in which writers write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes).</span></span> is an exercise in which you write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes). During the time limit, you may jot down any thoughts that come to your mind. Try not to worry about grammar, spelling, or punctuation. Instead, write as quickly as you can without stopping. If you get stuck, just copy the same word or phrase over and over until you come up with a new thought.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p02">Writing often comes easier when you have a personal connection with the topic you have chosen. Remember, to generate ideas in your freewriting, you may also think about readings that you have enjoyed or that have challenged your thinking. Doing this may lead your thoughts in interesting directions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p03">Quickly recording your thoughts on paper will help you discover what you have to say about a topic. When writing quickly, try not to doubt or question your ideas. Allow yourself to write freely and unselfconsciously. Once you start writing with few limitations, you may find you have more to say than you first realized. Your flow of thoughts can lead you to discover even more ideas about the topic. Freewriting may even lead you to discover another topic that excites you even more.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p04">Look at Mariah’s example. The instructor allowed the members of the class to choose their own topics, and Mariah thought about her experiences as a communications major. She used this freewriting exercise to help her generate more concrete ideas from her own experience.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_n01">

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s03_p05">Some prewriting strategies can be used together. For example, you could use experience and observations to come up with a topic related to your course studies. Then you could use freewriting to describe your topic in more detail and figure out what you have to say about it.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Asking Questions</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p01">Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? In everyday situations, you pose these kinds of questions to get more information. Who will be my partner for the project? When is the next meeting? Why is my car making that odd noise? Even the title of this chapter begins with the question “How do I begin?”</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p02">You seek the answers to these questions to gain knowledge, to better understand your daily experiences, and to plan for the future. Asking these types of questions will also help you with the writing process. As you choose your topic, answering these questions can help you revisit the ideas you already have and generate new ways to think about your topic. You may also discover aspects of the topic that are unfamiliar to you and that you would like to learn more about. All these idea-gathering techniques will help you plan for future work on your assignment.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p03">When Mariah reread her freewriting notes, she found she had rambled and her thoughts were disjointed. She realized that the topic that interested her most was the one she started with, the media. She then decided to explore that topic by asking herself questions about it. Her purpose was to refine media into a topic she felt comfortable writing about. To see how asking questions can help you choose a topic, take a look at the following chart that Mariah completed to record her questions and answers. She asked herself the questions that reporters and journalists use to gather information for their stories. The questions are often called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">5WH questions</a><span class="glossdef">The questions that reporters and journalists use to gather information for their stories and that writers use in the writing process: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How?</span></span>, after their initial letters.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s01_s01_s04_p04">Prewriting is very purpose driven; it does not follow a set of hard-and-fast rules. The purpose of prewriting is to find and explore ideas so that you will be prepared to write. A prewriting technique like asking questions can help you both find a topic and explore it. The key to effective prewriting is to use the techniques that work best for your thinking process. Freewriting may not seem to fit your thinking process, but keep an open mind. It may work better than you think. Perhaps brainstorming a list of topics might better fit your personal style. Mariah found freewriting and asking questions to be fruitful strategies to use. In your own prewriting, use the 5WH questions in any way that benefits your planning.</p>

Then read each question and use your own paper to answer the 5WH questions. As with Mariah when she explored her writing topic for more detail, it is OK if you do not know all the answers. If you do not know an answer, use your own opinion to speculate, or guess. You may also use factual information from books or articles you previously read on your topic. Later in the chapter, you will read about additional ways (like searching the Internet) to answer your questions and explore your guesses.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p01">Narrowing the focus means breaking up the topic into subtopics, or more specific points. Generating lots of subtopics will help you eventually select the ones that fit the assignment and appeal to you and your audience.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_p02">After rereading her syllabus, Mariah realized her general topic, mass media, is too broad for her class’s short paper requirement. Three pages are not enough to cover all the concerns in mass media today. Mariah also realized that although her readers are other communications majors who are interested in the topic, they may want to read a paper about a particular issue in mass media.</p>

Start with a blank sheet of paper (or a blank computer document) and write your general topic across the top. Underneath your topic, make a list of more specific ideas. Think of your general topic as a broad category and the list items as things that fit in that category. Often you will find that one item can lead to the next, creating a flow of ideas that can help you narrow your focus to a more specific paper topic.</p>

This technique is also known as clustering because ideas are broken down and clustered, or grouped together. Many writers like this method because the shapes show how the ideas relate or connect, and writers can find a focused topic from the connections mapped. Using idea mapping, you might discover interesting connections between topics that you had not thought of before.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s02_p02">To create an idea map, start with your general topic in a circle in the center of a blank sheet of paper.

Then, the general topic branches into two subtopics written in two smaller circles: television and radio. The subtopic television branches into even more specific topics: cable and DVDs. From there, Mariah drew more circles and wrote more specific ideas: high definition and digital recording from cable and Blu-ray from DVDs. The radio topic led Mariah to draw connections between music, downloads versus CDs, and, finally, piracy.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s01_s02_s01_s02_p05">From this idea map, Mariah saw she could consider narrowing the focus of her mass media topic to the more specific topic of music piracy.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizing Ideas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_p01">When you write, you need to organize your ideas in an order that makes sense. The writing you complete in all your courses exposes how analytically and critically your mind works. In some courses, the only direct contact you may have with your instructor is through the assignments you write for the course. You can make a good impression by spending time ordering your ideas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_p02">Order refers to your choice of what to present first, second, third, and so on in your writing. The order you pick closely relates to your purpose for writing that particular assignment. For example, when telling a story, it may be important to first describe the background for the action. Or you may need to first describe a 3-D movie projector or a television studio to help readers visualize the setting and scene. You may want to group your support effectively to convince readers that your point of view on an issue is well reasoned and worthy of belief.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_p03">In longer pieces of writing, you may organize different parts in different ways so that your purpose stands out clearly and all parts of the paper work together to consistently develop your main point.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Methods of Organizing Writing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p01">The three common methods of organizing writing are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chronological order</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to time.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spatial order</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to physical characteristics or appearance.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">order of importance</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to their significance.</span></span>. You will learn more about these in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>; however, you need to keep these methods of organization in mind as you plan how to arrange the information you have gathered in an outline. An outline is a written plan that serves as a skeleton for the paragraphs you write. Later, when you draft paragraphs in the next stage of the writing process, you will add support to create “flesh” and “muscle” for your assignment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p02">When you write, your goal is not only to complete an assignment but also to write for a specific purpose—perhaps to inform, to explain, to persuade, or for a combination of these purposes. Your purpose for writing should always be in the back of your mind, because it will help you decide which pieces of information belong together and how you will order them. In other words, choose the order that will most effectively fit your purpose and support your main point.</p>

Every nonfiction writing task—from the short essay to the ten-page term paper to the lengthy senior thesis—needs a big idea, or a controlling idea, as the spine for the work. The controlling idea is the main idea that you want to present and develop.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s02_p02">For a longer piece of writing, the main idea should be broader than the main idea for a shorter piece of writing. Be sure to frame a main idea that is appropriate for the length of the assignment. Ask yourself, “How many pages will it take for me to explain and explore this main idea in detail?” Be reasonable with your estimate. Then expand or trim it to fit the required length.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s02_p03">The big idea, or controlling idea, you want to present in an essay is expressed in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis statement</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Getting Started: Strategies For Drafting</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_p01">Your objective for this portion of <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> is to draft the body paragraphs of a standard five-paragraph essay. A five-paragraph essay contains an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. If you are more comfortable starting on paper than on the computer, you can start on paper and then type it before you revise. You can also use a voice recorder to get yourself started, dictating a paragraph or two to get you thinking. In this lesson, Mariah does all her work on the computer, but you may use pen and paper or the computer to write a rough draft.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">What makes the writing process so beneficial to writers is that it encourages alternatives to standard practices while motivating you to develop your best ideas. For instance, the following approaches, done alone or in combination with others, may improve your writing and help you move forward in the writing process:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Begin writing with the part you know the most about.</strong> You can start with the third paragraph in your outline if ideas come easily to mind. You can start with the second paragraph or the first paragraph, too. Although paragraphs may vary in length, keep in mind that short paragraphs may contain insufficient support. Readers may also think the writing is abrupt. Long paragraphs may be wordy and may lose your reader’s interest. As a guideline, try to write paragraphs longer than one sentence but shorter than the length of an entire double-spaced page.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Write one paragraph at a time and then stop.</strong> As long as you complete the assignment on time, you may choose how many paragraphs you complete in one sitting. Pace yourself. On the other hand, try not to procrastinate. Writers should always meet their deadlines.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take short breaks to refresh your mind.</strong> This tip might be most useful if you are writing a multipage report or essay. Still, if you are antsy or cannot concentrate, take a break to let your mind rest. But do not let breaks extend too long. If you spend too much time away from your essay, you may have trouble starting again. You may forget key points or lose momentum. Try setting an alarm to limit your break, and when the time is up, return to your desk to write.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be reasonable with your goals.</strong> If you decide to take ten-minute breaks, try to stick to that goal. If you told yourself that you need more facts, then commit to finding them. Holding yourself to your own goals will create successful writing assignments.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your audience and purpose in mind as you write.</strong> These aspects of writing are just as important when you are writing a single paragraph for your essay as when you are considering the direction of the entire essay.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p02">Of all of these considerations, keeping your purpose and your audience at the front of your mind is the most important key to writing success. If your purpose is to persuade, for example, you will present your facts and details in the most logical and convincing way you can.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p03">Your purpose will guide your mind as you compose your sentences. Your audience will guide word choice. Are you writing for experts, for a general audience, for other college students, or for people who know very little about your topic? Keep asking yourself what your readers, with their background and experience, need to be told in order to understand your ideas. How can you best express your ideas so they are totally clear and your communication is effective?</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p04">You may want to identify your purpose and audience on an index card that you clip to your paper (or keep next to your computer). On that card, you may want to write notes to yourself—perhaps about what that audience might not know or what it needs to know—so that you will be sure to address those issues when you write. It may be a good idea to also state exactly what you want to explain to that audience, or to inform them of, or to persuade them about.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p05">Many of the documents you produce at work target a particular audience for a particular purpose. You may find that it is highly advantageous to know as much as you can about your target audience and to prepare your message to reach that audience, even if the audience is a coworker or your boss. Menu language is a common example. Descriptions like “organic romaine” and “free-range chicken” are intended to appeal to a certain type of customer though perhaps not to the same customer who craves a thick steak. Similarly, mail-order companies research the demographics of the people who buy their merchandise. Successful vendors customize product descriptions in catalogs to appeal to their buyers’ tastes. For example, the product descriptions in a skateboarder catalog will differ from the descriptions in a clothing catalog for mature adults.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p01">A draft is a complete version of a piece of writing, but it is not the final version. The step in the writing process after drafting, as you may remember, is revising. During revising, you will have the opportunity to make changes to your first draft before you put the finishing touches on it during the editing and proofreading stage. A first draft gives you a working version that you can later improve.</p>

Collaborators do not need to be in the same room, the same building, or even the same city. Many collaborations are conducted over the Internet.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p03">In a perfect collaboration, each contributor has the right to add, edit, and delete text.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p01">If you have been using the information in this chapter step by step to help you develop an assignment, you already have both a formal topic outline and a formal sentence outline to direct your writing. Knowing what a first draft looks like will help you make the creative leap from the outline to the first draft. A first draft should include the following elements:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">introduction</a><span class="glossdef">The opening paragraph of an essay that piques the audience’s interest, tells what the essay is about, and motivates the audience to keep reading.</span></span> that piques the audience’s interest, tells what the essay is about, and motivates readers to keep reading.</li>

                <li>A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">The sentence in a paragraph that controls the point of the paragraph.

                <li>

            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_p02">These elements follow the standard five-paragraph essay format, which you probably first encountered in high school. This basic format is valid for most essays you will write in college, even much longer ones. For now, however, Mariah focuses on writing the three body paragraphs from her outline. <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a> covers writing introductions and conclusions, and you will read Mariah’s introduction and conclusion in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of Topic Sentences</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p01">Topic sentences make the structure of a text and the writer’s basic arguments easy to locate and comprehend. In college writing, using a topic sentence in each paragraph of the essay is the standard rule. However, the topic sentence does not always have to be the first sentence in your paragraph even if it the first item in your formal outline.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_n01">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p02">When you begin to draft your paragraphs, you should follow your outline fairly closely. After all, you spent valuable time developing those ideas. However, as you begin to express your ideas in complete sentences, it might strike you that the topic sentence might work better at the end of the paragraph or in the middle. Try it. Writing a draft, by its nature, is a good time for experimentation.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p03">The topic sentence can be the first, middle, or final sentence in a paragraph. The assignment’s audience and purpose will often determine where a topic sentence belongs. When the purpose of the assignment is to persuade, for example, the topic sentence should be the first sentence in a paragraph. In a persuasive essay, the writer’s point of view should be clearly expressed at the beginning of each paragraph.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p04">Choosing where to position the topic sentence depends not only on your audience and purpose but also on the essay’s arrangement, or order. When you organize information according to order of importance, the topic sentence may be the final sentence in a paragraph. All the supporting sentences build up to the topic sentence. Chronological order may also position the topic sentence as the final sentence because the controlling idea of the paragraph may make the most sense at the end of a sequence.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p05">When you organize information according to spatial order, a topic sentence may appear as the middle sentence in a paragraph. An essay arranged by spatial order often contains paragraphs that begin with descriptions. A reader may first need a visual in his or her mind before understanding the development of the paragraph. When the topic sentence is in the middle, it unites the details that come before it with the ones that come after it.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s01_p06">As you read critically throughout the writing process, keep topic sentences in mind. You may discover topic sentences that are not always located at the beginning of a paragraph. For example, fiction writers customarily use topic ideas, either expressed or implied, to move readers through their texts. In nonfiction writing, such as popular magazines, topic sentences are often used when the author thinks it is appropriate (based on the audience and the purpose, of course). A single topic sentence might even control the development of a number of paragraphs. For more information on topic sentences, please see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch06#fresh-ch06">Chapter 6 "Writing Paragraphs: Separating Ideas and Shaping Content"</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Paragraphs</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p01">The paragraph is the main structural component of an essay as well as other forms of writing. Each paragraph of an essay adds another related main idea to support the writer’s thesis, or controlling idea. Each related main idea is supported and developed with facts, examples, and other details that explain it. By exploring and refining one main idea at a time, writers build a strong case for their thesis.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Paragraph Length</strong></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p03">How long should a paragraph be?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p04">One answer to this important question may be “long enough”—long enough for you to address your points and explain your main idea. To grab attention or to present succinct supporting ideas, a paragraph can be fairly short and consist of two to three sentences. A paragraph in a complex essay about some abstract point in philosophy or archaeology can be three-quarters of a page or more in length. As long as the writer maintains close focus on the topic and does not ramble, a long paragraph is acceptable in college-level writing. In general, try to keep the paragraphs longer than one sentence but shorter than one full page of double-spaced text.</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_n01">
                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p05">Journalistic style often calls for brief two- or three-sentence paragraphs because of how people read the news, both online and in print. Blogs and other online information sources often adopt this paragraphing style, too. Readers often skim the first paragraphs of a great many articles before settling on the handful of stories they want to read in detail.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p06">You may find that a particular paragraph you write may be longer than one that will hold your audience’s interest. In such cases, you should divide the paragraph into two or more shorter paragraphs, adding a topic statement or some kind of transitional word or phrase at the start of the new paragraph. Transition words or phrases show the connection between the two ideas.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s01_s03_s02_p07">In all cases, however, be guided by what you instructor wants and expects to find in your draft. Many instructors will expect you to develop a mature college-level style as you progress through the semester’s assignments.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p09">If you write your first draft on the computer, consider creating a new file folder for each course with a set of subfolders inside the course folders for each assignment you are given. Label the folders clearly with the course names, and label each assignment folder and word processing document with a title that you will easily recognize. The assignment name is a good choice for the document. Then use that subfolder to store all the drafts you create. When you start each new draft, do not just write over the last one. Instead, save the draft with a new tag after the title—draft 1, draft 2, and so on—so that you will have a complete history of drafts in case your instructor wishes you to submit them.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s03_s02_p10">In your documents, observe any formatting requirements—for margins, headers, placement of page numbers, and other layout matters—that your instructor requires.</p>

                    <li>Use your topic outline or your sentence outline to guide the development of your paragraphs and the elaboration of your ideas.

Both are very important elements of the writing process. You may think that a completed first draft means little improvement is needed. However, even experienced writers need to improve their drafts and rely on peers during revising and editing. You may know that athletes miss catches, fumble balls, or overshoot goals. Dancers forget steps, turn too slowly, or miss beats. For both athletes and dancers, the more they practice, the stronger their performance will become. Web designers seek better images, a more clever design, or a more appealing background for their web pages. Writing has the same capacity to profit from improvement and revision.</p>

You also need to train your eye and trust your ability to fix what needs fixing. For this, you need to teach yourself where to look.</p>

Other writers unleash a lot of words in order to get out all that they feel they need to say. Do either of these composing styles match your style? Or is your composing style somewhere in between? No matter which description best fits you, the first draft of almost every piece of writing, no matter its author, can be made clearer and more concise.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s03_s02_p01">Most college essays should be written in formal English suitable for an academic situation. Follow these principles to be sure that your word choice is appropriate. For more information about word choice, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch04#fresh-ch04">Chapter 4 "Working with Words: Which Word Is Right?"</a>.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid slang.</strong> Find alternatives to <em class="emphasis">bummer</em>, <em class="emphasis">kewl</em>, and <em class="emphasis">rad</em>.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid language that is overly casual.</strong> Write about “men and women” rather than “girls and guys” unless you are trying to create a specific effect. A formal tone calls for formal language.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid contractions.</strong> Use <em class="emphasis">do not</em> in place of <em class="emphasis">don’t</em>, <em class="emphasis">I am</em> in place of <em class="emphasis">I’m</em>, <em class="emphasis">have not</em> in place of <em class="emphasis">haven’t</em>, and so on. Contractions are considered casual speech.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid clichés.</strong> Overused expressions such as <em class="emphasis">green with envy</em>, <em class="emphasis">face the music</em>, <em class="emphasis">better late than never</em>, and similar expressions are empty of meaning and may not appeal to your audience.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be careful when you use words that sound alike but have different meanings.</strong> Some examples are <em class="emphasis">allusion/illusion</em>, <em class="emphasis">complement/compliment</em>, <em class="emphasis">council/counsel</em>, <em class="emphasis">concurrent/consecutive</em>, <em class="emphasis">founder/flounder</em>, and <em class="emphasis">historic/historical</em>. When in doubt, check a dictionary.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose words with the connotations you want.</strong> Choosing a word for its connotations is as important in formal essay writing as it is in all kinds of writing. Compare the positive connotations of the word <em class="emphasis">proud</em> and the negative connotations of <em class="emphasis">arrogant</em> and <em class="emphasis">conceited</em>.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use specific words rather than overly general words.</strong> Find synonyms for <em class="emphasis">thing</em>, <em class="emphasis">people</em>, <em class="emphasis">nice</em>, <em class="emphasis">good</em>, <em class="emphasis">bad</em>, <em class="emphasis">interesting</em>, and other vague words.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_p01">After working so closely with a piece of writing, writers often need to step back and ask for a more objective reader. What writers most need is feedback from readers who can respond only to the words on the page. When they are ready, writers show their drafts to someone they respect and who can give an honest response about its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_p02">You, too, can ask a peer to read your draft when it is ready. After evaluating the feedback and assessing what is most helpful, the reader’s feedback will help you when you revise your draft. This process is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">peer review</a><span class="glossdef">The process in which a writer allows a peer to read and evaluate a draft.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_p03">You can work with a partner in your class and identify specific ways to strengthen each other’s essays. Although you may be uncomfortable sharing your writing at first, remember that each writer is working toward the same goal: a final draft that fits the audience and the purpose. Maintaining a positive attitude when providing feedback will put you and your partner at ease. The box that follows provides a useful framework for the peer review session.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_s01_p01">The purpose of peer feedback is to receive constructive criticism of your essay. Your peer reviewer is your first real audience, and you have the opportunity to learn what confuses and delights a reader so that you can improve your work before sharing the final draft with a wider audience (or your intended audience).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_s01_p02">It may not be necessary to incorporate every recommendation your peer reviewer makes. However, if you start to observe a pattern in the responses you receive from peer reviewers, you might want to take that feedback into consideration in future assignments. For example, if you read consistent comments about a need for more research, then you may want to consider including more research in future assignments.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_s01_s01_p02">You need to evaluate the responses you receive according to two important criteria:</p>

So far, all your changes have been content changes. Perhaps with the help of peer feedback, you have made sure that you sufficiently supported your ideas. You have checked for problems with unity and coherence. You have examined your essay for word choice, revising to cut unnecessary words and to replace weak wording with specific and appropriate wording.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p02">The next step after revising the content is editing. When you edit, you examine the surface features of your text.

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p03">Editing often takes time. Budgeting time into the writing process allows you to complete additional edits after revising. Editing and proofreading your writing helps you create a finished work that represents your best efforts. Here are a few more tips to remember about your readers:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_l01">
                <li>Readers do not notice correct spelling, but they <em class="emphasis">do</em> notice misspellings.</li>
                <li>Readers look past your sentences to get to your ideas—unless the sentences are awkward, poorly constructed, and frustrating to read.</li>
                <li>Readers notice when every sentence has the same rhythm as every other sentence, with no variety.</li>
                <li>Readers do not cheer when you use <em class="emphasis">there</em>, <em class="emphasis">their</em>, and <em class="emphasis">they’re</em> correctly, but they notice when you do not.</li>
                <li>Readers will notice the care with which you handled your assignment and your attention to detail in the delivery of an error-free document..</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p04">The first section of this book offers a useful review of grammar, mechanics, and usage. Use it to help you eliminate major errors in your writing and refine your understanding of the conventions of language. Do not hesitate to ask for help, too, from peer tutors in your academic department or in the college’s writing lab. In the meantime, use the checklist to help you edit your writing.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p09">Be careful about relying too much on spelling checkers and grammar checkers. A spelling checker cannot recognize that you meant to write <em class="emphasis">principle</em> but wrote <em class="emphasis">principal</em> instead. A grammar checker often queries constructions that are perfectly correct. The program does not understand your meaning; it makes its check against a general set of formulas that might not apply in each instance. If you use a grammar checker, accept the suggestions that make sense, but consider why the suggestions came up.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p10">Proofreading requires patience; it is very easy to read past a mistake. Set your paper aside for at least a few hours, if not a day or more, so your mind will rest. Some professional proofreaders read a text backward so they can concentrate on spelling and punctuation. Another helpful technique is to slowly read a paper aloud, paying attention to every word, letter, and punctuation mark.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p11">If you need additional proofreading help, ask a reliable friend, a classmate, or a peer tutor to make a final pass on your paper to look for anything you missed.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_s01_p01">Remember to use proper format when creating your finished assignment. Sometimes an instructor, a department, or a college will require students to follow specific instructions on titles, margins, page numbers, or the location of the writer’s name. These requirements may be more detailed and rigid for research projects and term papers, which often observe the American Psychological Association (APA) or Modern Language Association (MLA) style guides, especially when citations of sources are included.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_s01_p02">To ensure the format is correct and follows any specific instructions, make a final check before you submit an assignment.</p>

                    <li>Revising and editing are the stages of the writing process in which you improve your work before producing a final draft.</li>
                    <li>During revising, you add, cut, move, or change information in order to improve content.</li>
                    <li>During editing, you take a second look at the words and sentences you used to express your ideas and fix any problems in grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure.</li>
                    <li>Unity in writing means that all the ideas in each paragraph and in the entire essay clearly belong together and are arranged in an order that makes logical sense.</li>
                    <li>Coherence in writing means that the writer’s wording clearly indicates how one idea leads to another within a paragraph and between paragraphs.</li>
                    <li>Transitional words and phrases effectively make writing more coherent.</li>
                    <li>Writing should be clear and concise, with no unnecessary words.</li>
                    <li>Effective formal writing uses specific, appropriate words and avoids slang, contractions, clichés, and overly general words.</li>
                    <li>Peer reviews, done properly, can give writers objective feedback about their writing. It is the writer’s responsibility to evaluate the results of peer reviews and incorporate only useful feedback.</li>
                    <li>Remember to budget time for careful editing and proofreading. Use all available resources, including editing checklists, peer editing, and your institution’s writing lab, to improve your editing skills.</li>

            <li>In this chapter, you have thought and read about the topic of mass media. Starting with the title “The Future of Information: How It Will Be Created, Transmitted, and Consumed,” narrow the focus of the topic until it is suitable for a two- to three-page paper. Then narrow your topic with the help of brainstorming, idea mapping, and searching the Internet until you select a final topic to explore. Keep a journal or diary in which you record and comment on everything you did to choose a final topic. Then record what you will do next to explore the idea and create a thesis statement.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Write a thesis statement and a formal sentence outline for an essay about the writing process. Include separate paragraphs for prewriting, drafting, and revising and editing. Your audience will be a general audience of educated adults who are unfamiliar with how writing is taught at the college level.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Group activity.</strong> At work, an employer might someday ask you to contribute to the research base for an essay such as the one Mariah wrote or the one you wrote while working through this chapter. Choosing either her topic or your own, compile a list of at least five sources. Then, working in a group of four students, bring in printouts or PDF files of Internet sources or paper copies of non-Internet sources for the other group members to examine. In a group report, rate the reliability of each other’s sources.</li>
