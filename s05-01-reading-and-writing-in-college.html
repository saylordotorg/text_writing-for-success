    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p01">As you begin this chapter, you may be wondering why you need an introduction. After all, you have been writing and reading since elementary school. You completed numerous assessments of your reading and writing skills in high school and as part of your application process for college. You may write on the job, too. Why is a college writing course even necessary?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p02">When you are eager to get started on the coursework in your major that will prepare you for your career, getting excited about an introductory college writing course can be difficult. However, regardless of your field of study, honing your writing skills—and your reading and critical-thinking skills—gives you a more solid academic foundation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p03">In college, academic expectations change from what you may have experienced in high school. The quantity of work you are expected to do is increased. When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your work load can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p04">The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject. Educationally, you are moving into deeper waters. A good introductory writing course will help you swim.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p07">Throughout this chapter, you will follow a first-year student named Crystal. After several years of working as a saleswoman in a department store, Crystal has decided to pursue a degree in elementary education and become a teacher. She is continuing to work part-time, and occasionally she finds it challenging to balance the demands of work, school, and caring for her four-year-old son. As you read about Crystal, think about how you can use her experience to get the most out of your own college experience.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reading Strategies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_p01">Your college courses will sharpen both your reading and your writing skills. Most of your writing assignments—from brief response papers to in-depth research projects—will depend on your understanding of course reading assignments or related readings you do on your own. And it is difficult, if not impossible, to write effectively about a text that you have not understood. Even when you do understand the reading, it can be hard to write about it if you do not feel personally engaged with the ideas discussed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_p02">This section discusses strategies you can use to get the most out of your college reading assignments. These strategies fall into three broad categories:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Planning strategies.</strong> To help you manage your reading assignments.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Comprehension strategies.</strong> To help you understand the material.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Active reading strategies.</strong> To take your understanding to a higher and deeper level.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Planning Your Reading</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_p01">Have you ever stayed up all night cramming just before an exam? Or found yourself skimming a detailed memo from your boss five minutes before a crucial meeting? The first step in handling college reading successfully is planning. This involves both managing your time and setting a clear purpose for your reading.</p>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Your Reading Time</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">You will learn more detailed strategies for time management in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch01_s02#fresh-ch01_s02">Section 1.2 "Developing Study Skills"</a>, but for now, focus on setting aside enough time for reading and breaking your assignments into manageable chunks. If you are assigned a seventy-page chapter to read for next week’s class, try not to wait until the night before to get started. Give yourself at least a few days and tackle one section at a time.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">Your method for breaking up the assignment will depend on the type of reading. If the text is very dense and packed with unfamiliar terms and concepts, you may need to read no more than five or ten pages in one sitting so that you can truly understand and process the information. With more user-friendly texts, you will be able to handle longer sections—twenty to forty pages, for instance. And if you have a highly engaging reading assignment, such as a novel you cannot put down, you may be able to read lengthy passages in one sitting.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p03">As the semester progresses, you will develop a better sense of how much time you need to allow for the reading assignments in different subjects. It also makes sense to preview each assignment well in advance to assess its difficulty level and to determine how much reading time to set aside.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p04">College instructors often set aside reserve readings for a particular course. These consist of articles, book chapters, or other texts that are not part of the primary course textbook. Copies of reserve readings are available through the university library; in print; or, more often, online. When you are assigned a reserve reading, download it ahead of time (and let your instructor know if you have trouble accessing it). Skim through it to get a rough idea of how much time you will need to read the assignment in full.</p>

            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Setting a Purpose</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_p01">The other key component of planning is setting a purpose. Knowing what you want to get out of a reading assignment helps you determine how to approach it and how much time to spend on it. It also helps you stay focused during those occasional moments when it is late, you are tired, and relaxing in front of the television sounds far more appealing than curling up with a stack of journal articles.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_p02">Sometimes your purpose is simple. You might just need to understand the reading material well enough to discuss it intelligently in class the next day. However, your purpose will often go beyond that. For instance, you might also read to compare two texts, to formulate a personal response to a text, or to gather ideas for future research. Here are some questions to ask to help determine your purpose:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                    <li>
                        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">How did my instructor frame the assignment?</strong> Often your instructors will tell you what they expect you to get out of the reading:</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_l02">
                            <li>Read Chapter 2 and come to class prepared to discuss current teaching practices in elementary math.</li>
                            <li>Read these two articles and compare Smith’s and Jones’s perspectives on the 2010 health care reform bill.</li>
                            <li>Read Chapter 5 and think about how you could apply these guidelines to running your own business.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How deeply do I need to understand the reading?</strong> If you are majoring in computer science and you are assigned to read Chapter 1, “Introduction to Computer Science,” it is safe to assume the chapter presents fundamental concepts that you will be expected to master. However, for some reading assignments, you may be expected to form a general understanding but not necessarily master the content. Again, pay attention to how your instructor presents the assignment.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How does this assignment relate to other course readings or to concepts discussed in class?</strong> Your instructor may make some of these connections explicitly, but if not, try to draw connections on your own. (Needless to say, it helps to take detailed notes both when in class and when you read.)</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How might I use this text again in the future?</strong> If you are assigned to read about a topic that has always interested you, your reading assignment might help you develop ideas for a future research paper. Some reading assignments provide valuable tips or summaries worth bookmarking for future reference. Think about what you can take from the reading that will stay with you.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_p01">You have blocked out time for your reading assignments and set a purpose for reading. Now comes the challenge: making sure you actually understand all the information you are expected to process. Some of your reading assignments will be fairly straightforward. Others, however, will be longer or more complex, so you will need a plan for how to handle them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_p02">For any <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">expository writing</a><span class="glossdef">Writing that conveys facts or descriptions.</span></span>—that is, nonfiction, informational writing—your first comprehension goal is to identify the main points and relate any details to those main points. Because college-level texts can be challenging, you will also need to monitor your reading comprehension. That is, you will need to stop periodically and assess how well you understand what you are reading. Finally, you can improve comprehension by taking time to determine which strategies work best for you and putting those strategies into practice.</p>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Identifying the Main Points</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p01">In college, you will read a wide variety of materials, including the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Textbooks.</strong> These usually include summaries, glossaries, comprehension questions, and other study aids.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Nonfiction trade books.</strong> These are less likely to include the study features found in textbooks.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Popular magazine, newspaper, or web articles.</strong> These are usually written for a general audience.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Scholarly books and journal articles.</strong> These are written for an audience of specialists in a given field.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p02">Regardless of what type of expository text you are assigned to read, your primary comprehension goal is to identify the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">main point</a><span class="glossdef">The most important idea that a writer wants to communicate, often stated early in the writing.</span></span>: the most important idea that the writer wants to communicate and often states early on. Finding the main point gives you a framework to organize the details presented in the reading and relate the reading to concepts you learned in class or through other reading assignments. After identifying the main point, you will find the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supporting points</a><span class="glossdef">Details, facts, and explanations that develop and clarify a writer’s main point.</span></span>, the details, facts, and explanations that develop and clarify the main point.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p03">Some texts make that task relatively easy. Textbooks, for instance, include the aforementioned features as well as headings and subheadings intended to make it easier for students to identify core concepts. Graphic features, such as sidebars, diagrams, and charts, help students understand complex information and distinguish between essential and inessential points. When you are assigned to read from a textbook, be sure to use available comprehension aids to help you identify the main points.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p04">Trade books and popular articles may not be written specifically for an educational purpose; nevertheless, they also include features that can help you identify the main ideas. These features include the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_l02">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Trade books.</strong> Many trade books include an introduction that presents the writer’s main ideas and purpose for writing. Reading chapter titles (and any subtitles within the chapter) will help you get a broad sense of what is covered. It also helps to read the beginning and ending paragraphs of a chapter closely. These paragraphs often sum up the main ideas presented.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Popular articles.</strong> Reading the headings and introductory paragraphs carefully is crucial. In magazine articles, these features (along with the closing paragraphs) present the main concepts. Hard news articles in newspapers present the gist of the news story in the lead paragraph, while subsequent paragraphs present increasingly general details.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p05">At the far end of the reading difficulty scale are scholarly books and journal articles. Because these texts are written for a specialized, highly educated audience, the authors presume their readers are already familiar with the topic. The language and writing style is sophisticated and sometimes dense.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p06">When you read scholarly books and journal articles, try to apply the same strategies discussed earlier. The introduction usually presents the writer’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay. A thesis statement is often one sentence long, and it states the writer’s point of view.</span></span>, the idea or hypothesis the writer is trying to prove. Headings and subheadings can help you understand how the writer has organized support for his or her thesis. Additionally, academic journal articles often include a summary at the beginning, called an abstract, and electronic databases include summaries of articles, too.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p01">Finding the main idea and paying attention to text features as you read helps you figure out what you should know. Just as important, however, is being able to figure out what you do not know and developing a strategy to deal with it.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p02">Textbooks often include comprehension questions in the margins or at the end of a section or chapter. As you read, stop occasionally to answer these questions on paper or in your head. Use them to identify sections you may need to reread, read more carefully, or ask your instructor about later.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p03">Even when a text does not have built-in comprehension features, you can actively monitor your own comprehension. Try these strategies, adapting them as needed to suit different kinds of texts:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Summarize.</strong> At the end of each section, pause to summarize the main points in a few sentences. If you have trouble doing so, revisit that section.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask and answer questions.</strong> When you begin reading a section, try to identify two to three questions you should be able to answer after you finish it. Write down your questions and use them to test yourself on the reading. If you cannot answer a question, try to determine why. Is the answer buried in that section of reading but just not coming across to you? Or do you expect to find the answer in another part of the reading?</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Do not read in a vacuum.</strong> Look for opportunities to discuss the reading with your classmates. Many instructors set up online discussion forums or blogs specifically for that purpose. Participating in these discussions can help you determine whether your understanding of the main points is the same as your peers’.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p04">These discussions can also serve as a reality check. If everyone in the class struggled with the reading, it may be exceptionally challenging. If it was a breeze for everyone but you, you may need to see your instructor for help.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p05">As a working mother, Crystal found that the best time to get her reading done was in the evening, after she had put her four-year-old to bed. However, she occasionally had trouble concentrating at the end of a long day. She found that by actively working to summarize the reading and asking and answering questions, she focused better and retained more of what she read. She also found that evenings were a good time to check the class discussion forums that a few of her instructors had created.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p07">Students are often reluctant to seek help. They feel like doing so marks them as slow, weak, or demanding. The truth is, every learner occasionally struggles. If you are sincerely trying to keep up with the course reading but feel like you are in over your head, seek out help. Speak up in class, schedule a meeting with your instructor, or visit your university learning center for assistance.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_p01">Now that you have acquainted (or reacquainted) yourself with useful planning and comprehension strategies, college reading assignments may feel more manageable. You know what you need to do to get your reading done and make sure you grasp the main points. However, the most successful students in college are not only competent readers but active, engaged readers.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Using the SQ3R Strategy</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p01">One strategy you can use to become a more active, engaged reader is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SQ3R strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A widely used reading process that involves surveying the text and forming questions before reading; reading to answer questions, predict test material, and form new questions and predictions; reciting or recording the main points of the text; and reviewing and reflecting upon the material.</span></span>, a step-by-step process to follow before, during, and after reading. You may already use some variation of it. In essence, the process works like this:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Survey</strong> the text in advance.</li>
                    <li>Form <strong class="emphasis bold">questions</strong> before you start reading.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read</strong> the text.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Recite</strong> and/or <strong class="emphasis bold">record</strong> important points during and after reading.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Review</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">reflect</strong> on the text after you read.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p02">Before you read, you survey, or preview, the text. As noted earlier, reading introductory paragraphs and headings can help you begin to figure out the author’s main point and identify what important topics will be covered. However, surveying does not stop there. Look over sidebars, photographs, and any other text or graphic features that catch your eye. Skim a few paragraphs. Preview any boldfaced or italicized vocabulary terms. This will help you form a first impression of the material.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p03">Next, start brainstorming questions about the text. What do you expect to learn from the reading? You may find that some questions come to mind immediately based on your initial survey or based on previous readings and class discussions. If not, try using headings and subheadings in the text to formulate questions. For instance, if one heading in your textbook reads “Medicare and Medicaid,” you might ask yourself these questions:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_l02">
                    <li>When was Medicare and Medicaid legislation enacted? Why?</li>
                    <li>What are the major differences between these two programs?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p04">Although some of your questions may be simple factual questions, try to come up with a few that are more open-ended. Asking in-depth questions will help you stay more engaged as you read.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p05">The next step is simple: read. As you read, notice whether your first impressions of the text were correct. Are the author’s main points and overall approach about the same as what you predicted—or does the text contain a few surprises? Also, look for answers to your earlier questions and begin forming new questions. Continue to revise your impressions and questions as you read.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p06">While you are reading, pause occasionally to recite or record important points. It is best to do this at the end of each section or when there is an obvious shift in the writer’s train of thought. Put the book aside for a moment and recite aloud the main points of the section or any important answers you found there. You might also record ideas by jotting down a few brief notes in addition to, or instead of, reciting aloud. Either way, the physical act of articulating information makes you more likely to remember it.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p07">After you have completed the reading, take some time to review the material more thoroughly. If the textbook includes review questions or your instructor has provided a study guide, use these tools to guide your review. You will want to record information in a more detailed format than you used during reading, such as in an outline or a list.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p08">As you review the material, reflect on what you learned. Did anything surprise you, upset you, or make you think? Did you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with any points in the text? What topics would you like to explore further? Jot down your reflections in your notes. (Instructors sometimes require students to write brief response papers or maintain a reading journal. Use these assignments to help you reflect on what you read.)</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s02_p01">The SQ3R process encompasses a number of valuable active reading strategies: previewing a text, making predictions, asking and answering questions, and summarizing. You can use the following additional strategies to further deepen your understanding of what you read.</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s02_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Connect what you read to what you already know.</strong> Look for ways the reading supports, extends, or challenges concepts you have learned elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Relate the reading to your own life.</strong> What statements, people, or situations relate to your personal experiences?</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Visualize.</strong> For both fiction and nonfiction texts, try to picture what is described. Visualizing is especially helpful when you are reading a narrative text, such as a novel or a historical account, or when you read expository text that describes a process, such as how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pay attention to graphics as well as text.</strong> Photographs, diagrams, flow charts, tables, and other graphics can help make abstract ideas more concrete and understandable.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Understand the text in context.</strong> Understanding context means thinking about who wrote the text, when and where it was written, the author’s purpose for writing it, and what assumptions or agendas influenced the author’s ideas. For instance, two writers might both address the subject of health care reform, but if one article is an opinion piece and one is a news story, the context is different.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Plan to talk or write about what you read.</strong> Jot down a few questions or comments in your notebook so you can bring them up in class. (This also gives you a source of topic ideas for papers and presentations later in the semester.) Discuss the reading on a class discussion board or blog about it.</li>

These tools are a great way to reinforce learning. Do not be afraid to be the student who starts the discussion.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s02_p04">Remember that when you interact with other students and teachers online, you need to project a mature, professional image.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Common Writing Assignments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p01">College writing assignments serve a different purpose than the typical writing assignments you completed in high school. In high school, teachers generally focus on teaching you to write in a variety of modes and formats, including personal writing, expository writing, research papers, creative writing, and writing short answers and essays for exams. Over time, these assignments help you build a foundation of writing skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p02">In college, many instructors will expect you to already have that foundation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p03">Your college composition courses will focus on writing for its own sake, helping you make the transition to college-level writing assignments. However, in most other college courses, writing assignments serve a different purpose. In those courses, you may use writing as one tool among many for learning how to think about a particular academic discipline.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p04">Additionally, certain assignments teach you how to meet the expectations for professional writing in a given field. Depending on the class, you might be asked to write a lab report, a case study, a literary analysis, a business plan, or an account of a personal interview. You will need to learn and follow the standard conventions for those types of written products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p05">Finally, personal and creative writing assignments are less common in college than in high school. College courses emphasize expository writing, writing that explains or informs. Often expository writing assignments will incorporate outside research, too. Some classes will also require persuasive writing assignments in which you state and support your position on an issue. College instructors will hold you to a higher standard when it comes to supporting your ideas with reasons and evidence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p06"><a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch01_s01_s02_t01">Table 1.2 "Common Types of College Writing Assignments"</a> lists some of the most common types of college writing assignments. It includes minor, less formal assignments as well as major ones. Which specific assignments you encounter will depend on the courses you take and the learning objectives developed by your instructors.</p>
