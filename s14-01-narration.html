This chapter covers nine common rhetorical modes. As you read about these nine modes, keep in mind that the rhetorical mode a writer chooses depends on his or her purpose for writing.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Narrative Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p01">Narration means the art of storytelling, and the purpose of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">narrative writing</a><span class="glossdef">The art of telling stories.</span></span> is to tell stories. Any time you tell a story to a friend or family member about an event or incident in your day, you engage in a form of narration. In addition, a narrative can be factual or fictional. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">factual story</a><span class="glossdef">A story based on—and faithful to—actual events as they happened in real life.</span></span> is one that is based on, and tries to be faithful to, actual events as they unfolded in real life. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fictional story</a><span class="glossdef">A made-up, or imagined, story.</span></span> is a made-up, or imagined, story; the writer of a fictional story can create characters and events as he or she sees fit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p02">The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is based on a writer’s purpose. The writers of factual stories try to recount events as they actually happened, but writers of fictional stories can depart from real people and events because the writers’ intents are not to retell a real-life event. Biographies and memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas novels and short stories are examples of fictional stories.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p03">Because the line between fact and fiction can often blur, it is helpful to understand what your purpose is from the beginning. Is it important that you recount history, either your own or someone else’s? Or does your interest lie in reshaping the world in your own image—either how you would like to see it or how you imagine it could be? Your answers will go a long way in shaping the stories you tell.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p04">Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay a series of events in an emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to be moved by your story, which could mean through laughter, sympathy, fear, anger, and so on. The more clearly you tell your story, the more emotionally engaged your audience is likely to be.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p05">On a separate sheet of paper, start brainstorming ideas for a narrative. First, decide whether you want to write a factual or fictional story. Then, freewrite for five minutes. Be sure to use all five minutes, and keep writing the entire time. Do not stop and think about what to write.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s02_p01">Major narrative events are most often conveyed in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chronological order</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to time.</span></span>, the order in which events unfold from first to last. Stories typically have a beginning, a middle, and an end, and these events are typically organized by time.

Some of these phrases are listed in <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s01_s02_t01">Table 10.1 "Transition Words and Phrases for Expressing Time"</a>.

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s02_p03">When interviewing candidates for jobs, employers often ask about conflicts or problems a potential employee has had to overcome. They are asking for a compelling personal narrative. To prepare for this question in a job interview, write out a scenario using the narrative mode structure. This will allow you to troubleshoot rough spots, as well as better understand your own personal history. Both processes will make your story better and your self-presentation better, too.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing a Narrative Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p01">When writing a narrative essay, start by asking yourself if you want to write a factual or fictional story. Then freewrite about topics that are of general interest to you. For more information about freewriting, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p02">Once you have a general idea of what you will be writing about, you should sketch out the major events of the story that will compose your plot. Typically, these events will be revealed chronologically and climax at a central conflict that must be resolved by the end of the story. The use of strong details is crucial as you describe the events and characters in your narrative. You want the reader to emotionally engage with the world that you create in writing.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p03">To create strong details, keep the human senses in mind. You want your reader to be immersed in the world that you create, so focus on details related to sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch as you describe people, places, and events in your narrative.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p04">As always, it is important to start with a strong introduction to hook your reader into wanting to read more. Try opening the essay with an event that is interesting to introduce the story and get it going. Finally, your conclusion should help resolve the central conflict of the story and impress upon your reader the ultimate theme of the piece. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch15#fresh-ch15">Chapter 15 "Readings: Examples of Essays"</a> to read a sample narrative essay.</p>
