        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Illustration in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p01">To illustrate means to show or demonstrate something clearly. An effective <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">illustration essay</a><span class="glossdef">An essay that clearly demonstrates and supports a point through the use of evidence.</span></span> clearly demonstrates and supports a point through the use of evidence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p02">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>, the controlling idea of an essay is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay. A thesis statement is often one sentence long, and it states the writer’s point of view.</span></span>. A writer can use different types of evidence to support his or her thesis. Using scientific studies, experts in a particular field, statistics, historical events, current events, analogies, and personal anecdotes are all ways in which a writer can illustrate a thesis. Ultimately, you want the evidence to help the reader “see” your point, as one would see a good illustration in a magazine or on a website. The stronger your evidence is, the more clearly the reader will consider your point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p03">Using evidence effectively can be challenging, though. The evidence you choose will usually depend on your subject and who your reader is (your audience). When writing an illustration essay, keep in mind the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Use evidence that is appropriate to your topic as well as appropriate for your audience.</li>
            <li>Assess how much evidence you need to adequately explain your point depending on the complexity of the subject and the knowledge of your audience regarding that subject.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p04">For example, if you were writing about a new communication software and your audience was a group of English-major undergrads, you might want to use an analogy or a personal story to illustrate how the software worked. You might also choose to add a few more pieces of evidence to make sure the audience understands your point. However, if you were writing about the same subject and you audience members were information technology (IT) specialists, you would likely use more technical evidence because they would be familiar with the subject.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p05">Keeping in mind your subject in relation to your audience will increase your chances of effectively illustrating your point.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p06">You never want to insult your readers’ intelligence by overexplaining concepts the audience members may already be familiar with, but it may be necessary to clearly articulate your point. When in doubt, add an extra example to illustrate your idea.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Structure of an Illustration Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s02_p01">The controlling idea, or thesis, belongs at the beginning of the essay. Evidence is then presented in the essay’s body paragraphs to support the thesis. You can start supporting your main point with your strongest evidence first, or you can start with evidence of lesser importance and have the essay build to increasingly stronger evidence. This type of organization—<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">order of importance</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to their significance.</span></span>—you learned about in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s02_p02">The time transition words listed in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch10_s01#fresh-ch10_s01_s02_t01">Table 10.1 "Transition Words and Phrases for Expressing Time"</a> are also helpful in ordering the presentation of evidence. Words like <em class="emphasis">first</em>, <em class="emphasis">second</em>, <em class="emphasis">third</em>, <em class="emphasis">currently</em>, <em class="emphasis">next</em>, and <em class="emphasis">finally</em> all help orient the reader and sequence evidence clearly. Because an illustration essay uses so many examples, it is also helpful to have a list of words and phrases to present each piece of evidence. <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s02_s02_t01">Table 10.2 "Phrases of Illustration"</a> provides a list of phrases for illustration.</p>
