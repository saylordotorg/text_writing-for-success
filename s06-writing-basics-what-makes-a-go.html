    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_p01">Imagine you are reading a book for school. You need to find important details that you can use for an assignment. However, when you begin to read, you notice that the book has very little punctuation. Sentences fail to form complete paragraphs and instead form one block of text without clear organization. Most likely, this book would frustrate and confuse you. Without clear and concise sentences, it is difficult to find the information you need.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_p02">For both students and professionals, clear communication is important. Whether you are typing an e-mail or writing a report, it is your responsibility to present your thoughts and ideas clearly and precisely. Writing in complete sentences is one way to ensure that you communicate well. This section covers how to recognize and write basic sentence structures and how to avoid some common writing errors.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Components of a Sentence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Clearly written, complete sentences require key information: a subject, a verb and a complete idea. A sentence needs to make sense on its own. Sometimes, complete sentences are also called independent clauses. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">clause</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that contains a subject and a verb and may make up a complete sentence.</span></span> is a group of words that may make up a sentence.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s01_p02">All complete sentences have at least one independent clause. You can identify an independent clause by reading it on its own and looking for the subject and the verb.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s02_s02_s01_p01">Fragments often occur because of some common error, such as starting a sentence with a preposition, a dependent word, an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">infinitive</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form that combines the word <em class="emphasis">to</em> with a verb, such as <em class="emphasis">to buy</em>, <em class="emphasis">to go</em>, or <em class="emphasis">to gather</em>.</span></span>, or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gerund</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form ending in -<em class="emphasis">ing</em> that is used as a noun, such as <em class="emphasis">running</em>, <em class="emphasis">writing</em>, or <em class="emphasis">celebrating</em>.</span></span>. If you use the six basic sentence patterns when you write, you should be able to avoid these errors and thus avoid writing fragments.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s02_s02_s01_p02">When you see a preposition, check to see that it is part of a sentence containing a subject and a verb. If it is not connected to a complete sentence, it is a fragment, and you will need to fix this type of fragment by combining it with another sentence. You can add the prepositional phrase to the end of the sentence. If you add it to the beginning of the other sentence, insert a comma after the prepositional phrase.</p>

I told the project manager that we would be able to get the report to her later that day she suggested that we come back a day early to get the report done and I told her we had meetings until our flight took off. We e-mailed our contact who said that they would check with his boss, she said that the project could afford a delay as long as they wouldn’t have to make any edits or changes to the file our new deadline is next Friday.</li>
                        <li>Anna tried getting a reservation at the restaurant, but when she called they said that there was a waiting list so she put our names down on the list when the day of our reservation arrived we only had to wait thirty minutes because a table opened up unexpectedly which was good because we were able to catch a movie after dinner in the time we’d expected to wait to be seated.</li>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch02_s03_s03_p05">In the Middle Ages, most people lived in villages and work as agricultural laborers, or peasants. Every village has a “lord,” and the peasants worked on his land. Much of what they produce go to the lord and his family. What little food was leftover goes to support the peasants’ families. In return for their labor, the lord offers them protection. A peasant’s day usually began before sunrise and involves long hours of backbreaking work, which includes plowing the land, planting seeds, and cutting crops for harvesting. The working life of a peasant in the Middle Ages is usually demanding and exhausting.</p>

Diana and I have been close ever since she was young. Our mothers are twin sisters, and she is inseparable! Diana knows how much I love butterflies, so it was their special present to me. I have a soft spot for caterpillars too. I love them because something about the way it transforms is so interesting to me. One summer my grandmother gave me a butterfly growing kit, and you got to see the entire life cycle of five Painted Lady butterflies. I even got to set it free. So when my cousin said they wanted to take me to the butterfly exhibit, I was really excited!</p>

I told him that my dog, Jacko, was more smart than his dog, Merlin. I could not help myself. Merlin never came when he was called, and he chased his tail and barked at rocks. I told Max that Merlin was the most dumbest dog on the block. I guess I was angrier about a bad grade that I received, so I decided to pick on poor little Merlin. Even though Max insulted Jacko too, I felt I had been more mean. The next day I apologized to Max and brought Merlin some of Jacko’s treats. When Merlin placed his paw on my knee and licked my hand, I was the most sorry person on the block.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch02_s08_p22">lance worthington signed a Recording Contract with Capitol records on june 15, 2007. Despite selling two million copies of his Debut Album, nothing to lose, lance lost quite a bit as his tax returns from the irs revealed. lance did not think it was fair that the Record Company kept so much of his earnings, so he decided to hire robert bergman, a prominent music Attorney with a Shark-like reputation. bergman represented lance all the way to the supreme court, where lance won the case against capitol records. Lance worthington was instrumental in changing intellectual property rights and long standing Record Company practices. All artists and musicians can thank him for his brave stance against record companies. Lance subsequently formed his own independent record label called worthy records. worthy is now a successful Label based out of chicago, illinois, and its Artists have appeared on well known shows such as The tonight show and Saturday night live. Lance worthington is a model for success in the do-it-yourself World that has become the Music Industry.</p>
