    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-chpr_p02"><em class="emphasis">Writing for Success</em> is a text that provides instruction in steps, builds writing, reading, and critical thinking, and combines comprehensive grammar review with an introduction to paragraph writing and composition.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-chpr_p03">Beginning with the sentence and its essential elements, this book addresses each concept with clear, concise, and effective examples that are immediately reinforced with exercises and opportunities to demonstrate learning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-chpr_p04">Each chapter allows students to demonstrate mastery of the principles of quality writing. With its incremental approach, this book can address a range of writing levels and abilities, helping each student prepare for the next writing or university course. Constant reinforcement is provided through examples and exercises, and the text involves students in the learning process through reading, problem solving, practicing, listening, and experiencing the writing process.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-chpr_p05">Each chapter also has integrated examples that unify the discussion and form a common, easy-to-understand basis for discussion and exploration. This will put students at ease and allow for greater absorption of the material.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-chpr_p06">Tips for effective writing are included in every chapter, as well.
