    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_p01">Now that you have planned your research project, you are ready to begin the research. This phase can be both exciting and challenging. As you read this section, you will learn ways to locate sources efficiently, so you have enough time to read the sources, take notes, and think about how to use the information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_p02">Of course, the technological advances of the past few decades—particularly the rise of online media—mean that, as a twenty-first-century student, you have countless sources of information available at your fingertips. But how can you tell whether a source is reliable? This section will discuss strategies for evaluating sources critically so that you can be a media-savvy researcher.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_p03">In this section, you will locate and evaluate resources for your paper and begin taking notes. As you read, begin gathering print and electronic resources, identify at least eight to ten sources by the time you finish the chapter, and begin taking notes on your research findings.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Locating Useful Resources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s01_p01">When you chose a paper topic and determined your research questions, you conducted preliminary research to stimulate your thinking. Your research proposal included some general ideas for how to go about your research—for instance, interviewing an expert in the field or analyzing the content of popular magazines. You may even have identified a few potential sources. Now it is time to conduct a more focused, systematic search for informative primary and secondary sources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Primary and Secondary Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p01">Writers classify research resources in two categories: primary sources and secondary sources. <em class="emphasis">Primary sources</em> are direct, firsthand sources of information or data. For example, if you were writing a paper about the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, the text of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights would be a primary source.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p02">Other primary sources include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Research articles</li>
            <li>Literary texts</li>
            <li>Historical documents such as diaries or letters</li>
            <li>Autobiographies or other personal accounts</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p03"><em class="emphasis">Secondary sources</em> discuss, interpret, analyze, consolidate, or otherwise rework information from primary sources. In researching a paper about the First Amendment, you might read articles about legal cases that involved First Amendment rights, or editorials expressing commentary on the First Amendment. These sources would be considered secondary sources because they are one step removed from the primary source of information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p04">The following are examples of secondary sources:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_l02">
            <li>Magazine articles</li>
            <li>Biographical books</li>
            <li>Literary and scientific reviews</li>
            <li>Television documentaries</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p05">Your topic and purpose determine whether you must cite both primary and secondary sources in your paper. Ask yourself which sources are most likely to provide the information that will answer your research questions. If you are writing a research paper about reality television shows, you will need to use some reality shows as a primary source, but secondary sources, such as a reviewer’s critique, are also important. If you are writing about the health effects of nicotine, you will probably want to read the published results of scientific studies, but secondary sources, such as magazine articles discussing the outcome of a recent study, may also be helpful.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p06">Once you have thought about what kinds of sources are most likely to help you answer your research questions, you may begin your search for print and electronic resources. The challenge here is to conduct your search efficiently. Writers use strategies to help them find the sources that are most relevant and reliable while steering clear of sources that will not be useful.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Finding Print Resources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_p01">Print resources include a vast array of documents and publications. Regardless of your topic, you will consult some print resources as part of your research. (You will use electronic sources as well, but it is not wise to limit yourself to electronic sources only, because some potentially useful sources may be available only in print form.) <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_t01">Table 11.1 "Library Print Resources"</a> lists different types of print resources available at public and university libraries.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_p03">Businesses, government organizations, and nonprofit organizations produce published materials that range from brief advertisements and brochures to lengthy, detailed reports.

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_p05">As you gather information, strive for a balance of accessible, easy-to-read sources and more specialized, challenging sources.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_p08">You probably already have some keywords in mind based on your preliminary research and writing. Another way to identify useful keywords is to visit the Library of Congress’s website at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://id.loc.gov/authorities">http://id.loc.gov/authorities</a>. This site allows you to search for a topic and see the related subject headings used by the Library of Congress, including broader terms, narrower terms, and related terms. Other libraries use these terms to classify materials. Knowing the most-used terms will help you speed up your keyword search.</p>

Mass-market publications, such as newspapers and popular magazines, differ from scholarly publications in their accessibility, audience, and purpose.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s02_p02">Newspapers and magazines are written for a broader audience than scholarly journals. Their content is usually quite accessible and easy to read. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Trade magazines</a><span class="glossdef">Magazines that address topics relevant to a particular industry.</span></span> that target readers within a particular industry may presume the reader has background knowledge, but these publications are still reader-friendly for a broader audience. Their purpose is to inform and, often, to entertain or persuade readers as well.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Scholarly or academic journals</a><span class="glossdef">Periodicals that address topics in a specialized field and are geared toward an audience with prior expertise in the field.</span></span> are written for a much smaller and more expert audience. The creators of these publications assume that most of their readers are already familiar with the main topic of the journal. The target audience is also highly educated. Informing is the primary purpose of a scholarly journal. While a journal article may advance an agenda or advocate a position, the content will still be presented in an objective style and formal tone. Entertaining readers with breezy comments and splashy graphics is not a priority.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s02_p04">Because of these differences, scholarly journals are more challenging to read. That doesn’t mean you should avoid them. On the contrary, they can provide in-depth information unavailable elsewhere. Because knowledgeable professionals carefully review the content before publication, scholarly journals are far more reliable than much of the information available in popular media. Seek out academic journals along with other resources. Just be prepared to spend a little more time processing the information.</p>

If you are not sure how you should begin your search, or if it is yielding too many or too few results, you are not alone. Many students find this process challenging, although it does get easier with experience. One way to learn better search strategies is to consult a reference librarian.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s03_p02">Reference librarians are intimately familiar with the systems libraries use to organize and classify information. They can help you locate a particular book in the library stacks, steer you toward useful reference works, and provide tips on how to use databases and other electronic research tools. Take the time to see what resources you can find on your own, but if you encounter difficulties, ask for help. Many university librarians hold virtual office hours and are available for online chatting.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s03_p04">One way to refine your keyword search is to use Boolean operators. These operators allow you to combine keywords, find variations on a word, and otherwise expand or limit your results. Here are some of the ways you can use Boolean operators:</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s03_l02">
                        <li>Combine keywords with <strong class="emphasis bold">and</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">+</strong> to limit results to citations that include both keywords—for example, <strong class="emphasis bold">diet + nutrition</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Combine keywords with <strong class="emphasis bold">not</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">-</strong> to search for the first word without the second. This can help you eliminate irrelevant results based on words that are similar to your search term. For example, searching for <strong class="emphasis bold">obesity not childhood</strong> locates materials on obesity but excludes materials on childhood obesity.</li>
                        <li>Enclose a phrase in quotation marks to search for an exact phrase, such as “<strong class="emphasis bold">morbid obesity</strong>.”</li>
                        <li>Use parentheses to direct the order of operations in a search string. For example, since Type II diabetes is also known as adult-onset diabetes, you could search <strong class="emphasis bold">(Type II or adult-onset) and diabetes</strong> to limit your search results to articles on this form of the disease.</li>
                        <li>Use a wildcard symbol such as <strong class="emphasis bold">#</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">?</strong>, or <strong class="emphasis bold">$</strong> after a word to search for variations on a term. For instance, you might type <strong class="emphasis bold">diabet#</strong> to search for information on diabetes and diabetics. The specific symbol used varies with different databases.</li>

Some types of resources, such as a television documentary, may only be available electronically. Other resources—for instance, many newspapers and magazines—may be available in both print and electronic form. The following are some of the electronic sources you might consult:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Online databases</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s02_s01_p01">When faced with the challenge of writing a research paper, some students rely on popular search engines as their first source of information. Typing a keyword or phrase into a search engine instantly pulls up links to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of related websites—what could be easier? Unfortunately, despite its apparent convenience, this research strategy has the following drawbacks to consider:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Results do not always appear in order of reliability.</strong> The first few hits that appear in search results may include sites whose content is not always reliable, such as online encyclopedias that can be edited by any user. Because websites are created by third parties, the search engine cannot tell you which sites have accurate information.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Results may be too numerous for you to use.</strong> The amount of information available on the web is far greater than the amount of information housed within a particular library or database. Realistically, if your web search pulls up thousands of hits, you will not be able to visit every site—and the most useful sites may be buried deep within your search results.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Search engines are not connected to the results of the search.</strong> Search engines find websites that people visit often and list the results in order of popularity. The search engine, then, is not connected to any of the results. When you cite a source found through a search engine, you do not need to cite the search engine. Only cite the source.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s02_s01_p02">A general web search can provide a helpful overview of a topic and may pull up genuinely useful resources.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s03_p01">With so many print and electronic media readily available, it is easy to overlook another valuable information resource: other people. Consider whether you could use a person or group as a primary source. For instance, you might interview a professor who has expertise in a particular subject, a worker within a particular industry, or a representative from a political organization. Interviews can be a great way to get firsthand information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s03_p02">To get the most out of an interview, you will need to plan ahead. Contact your subject early in the research process and explain your purpose for requesting an interview. Prepare detailed questions. Open-ended questions, rather than questions with simple yes-or-no answers, are more likely to lead to an in-depth discussion. Schedule a time to meet, and be sure to obtain your subject’s permission to record the interview. Take careful notes and be ready to ask follow-up questions based on what you learn.</p>

It is easy for writers to get so caught up in checking out books and printing out articles that they forget to ask themselves how they will use these resources in their research. Now is a good time to get a little ruthless. Reading and taking notes takes time and energy, so you will want to focus on the most relevant sources.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_p01">All information sources are not created equal. Sources can vary greatly in terms of how carefully they are researched, written, edited, and reviewed for accuracy. Common sense will help you identify obviously questionable sources, such as tabloids that feature tales of alien abductions, or personal websites with glaring typos. Sometimes, however, a source’s reliability—or lack of it—is not so obvious. For more information about source reliability, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch12#fresh-ch12">Chapter 12 "Writing a Research Paper"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_p02">To evaluate your research sources, you will use critical thinking skills consciously and deliberately. You will consider criteria such as the type of source, its intended purpose and audience, the author’s (or authors’) qualifications, the publication’s reputation, any indications of bias or hidden agendas, how current the source is, and the overall quality of the writing, thinking, and design.</p>

They usually appear among the first few results of a web search. They cover thousands of topics, and many articles use an informal, straightforward writing style. Unfortunately, these sites have no control system for researching, writing, and reviewing articles. Instead, they rely on a community of users to police themselves. At best, these sites can be a starting point for finding other, more trustworthy sources. Never use them as final sources.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s02_p01">Even when you are using a type of source that is generally reliable, you will still need to evaluate the author’s credibility and the publication itself on an individual basis. To examine the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">author’s credibility</a><span class="glossdef">The extent to which an author’s writing about a topic is believable or trustworthy. Writers evaluate credibility by considering the author’s professional expertise or academic qualifications on the topic.</span></span>—that is, how much you can believe of what the author has to say—examine his or her credentials. What career experience or academic study shows that the author has the expertise to write about this topic?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s02_p02">Keep in mind that expertise in one field is no guarantee of expertise in another, unrelated area. For instance, an author may have an advanced degree in physiology, but this credential is not a valid qualification for writing about psychology. Check credentials carefully.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s02_p03">Just as important as the author’s credibility is the publication’s overall reputability. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Reputability</a><span class="glossdef">A publication’s established reputation as a respectable, reliable source of information.</span></span> refers to a source’s standing and reputation as a respectable, reliable source of information. An established and well-known newspaper, such as the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> or the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, is more reputable than a college newspaper put out by comparatively inexperienced students. A website that is maintained by a well-known, respected organization and regularly updated is more reputable than one created by an unknown author or group.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s02_p04">If you are using articles from scholarly journals, you can check databases that keep count of how many times each article has been cited in other articles.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s03_p01">Whenever you consult a source, always think carefully about the author’s or authors’ purpose in presenting the information.

For instance, an author may be biased against a certain political party and present information in a way that subtly—or not so subtly—makes that organization look bad. Bias can lead an author to present facts selectively, edit quotations to misrepresent someone’s words, and distort information.</p>

For instance, an article about the role of beef in a healthy diet would be questionable if it were written by a representative of the beef industry—or by the president of an animal-rights organization. In both cases, the author would likely have a hidden agenda.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s03_p04">As Jorge conducted his research, he read several research studies in which scientists found significant benefits to following a low-carbohydrate diet. He also noticed that many studies were sponsored by a foundation associated with the author of a popular series of low-carbohydrate diet books.

Depending on the topic, sources may become outdated relatively soon after publication, or they may remain useful for years. For instance, online social networking sites have evolved rapidly over the past few years. An article published in 2002 about this topic will not provide current information. On the other hand, a research paper on elementary education practices might refer to studies published decades ago by influential child psychologists.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s04_p02">When using websites for research, check to see when the site was last updated. Many sites publish this information on the homepage, and some, such as news sites, are updated daily or weekly. Many nonfunctioning links are a sign that a website is not regularly updated. Do not be afraid to ask your professor for suggestions if you find that many of your most relevant sources are not especially reliable—or that the most reliable sources are not relevant.</p>

                        <li>Does the author support ideas with specific facts and details that are carefully documented? Is the source of the author’s information clear? (When you use secondary sources, look for sources that are not too removed from primary research.)</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_p01">As you determine which sources you will rely on most, it is important to establish a system for keeping track of your sources and taking notes. There are several ways to go about it, and no one system is necessarily superior.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s01_p01">Think ahead to a moment a few weeks from now, when you’ve written your research paper and are almost ready to submit it for a grade. There is just one task left—writing your list of sources.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s01_p02">As you begin typing your list, you realize you need to include the publication information for a book you cited frequently. Unfortunately, you already returned it to the library several days ago. You do not remember the URLs for some of the websites you used or the dates you accessed them—information that also must be included in your bibliography. With a sinking feeling, you realize that finding this information and preparing your bibliography will require hours of work.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s01_p03">This stressful scenario can be avoided. Taking time to organize source information now will ensure that you are not scrambling to find it at the last minute. Throughout your research, record bibliographical information for each source as soon as you begin using it. You may use pen-and-paper methods, such as a notebook or note cards, or maintain an electronic list. (If you prefer the latter option, many office software packages include separate programs for recording bibliographic information.)</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Use Headings to Organize Ideas</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s01_p01">Whether you use old-fashioned index cards or organize your notes using word-processing software, record just one major point from each source at a time, and use a heading to summarize the information covered. Keep all your notes in one file, digital or otherwise. Doing so will help you identify connections among different pieces of information. It will also help you make connections between your notes and the research questions and subtopics you identified earlier.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Know When to Summarize, Paraphrase, or Directly Quote a Source</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s02_p01">Your notes will fall under three categories—summary notes, paraphrased information, and direct quotations from your sources. Effective researchers make choices about which type of notes is most appropriate for their purpose.</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s02_l01">
                    <li>

A summary is considerably shorter than the original text.</span></span> sum up the main ideas in a source in a few sentences or a short paragraph. A summary is considerably shorter than the original text and captures only the major ideas. Use summary notes when you do not need to record specific details but you intend to refer to broad concepts the author discusses.</li>

It is a good strategy to copy direct quotations when an author expresses an idea in an especially lively or memorable way. However, do not rely exclusively on direct quotations in your note taking.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s02_p02">Most of your notes should be paraphrased from the original source. Paraphrasing as you take notes is usually a better strategy than copying direct quotations, because it forces you to think through the information in your source and understand it well enough to restate it. In short, it helps you stay engaged with the material instead of simply copying and pasting. Synthesizing will help you later when you begin planning and drafting your paper.

                <h2 class="title editable block">Maintain Complete, Accurate Notes</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_p01">Regardless of the format used, any notes you take should include enough information to help you organize ideas and locate them instantly in the original text if you need to review them. Make sure your notes include the following elements:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_l01">
                    <li>Heading summing up the main topic covered</li>
                    <li>Author’s name, a source code, or an abbreviated source title</li>
                    <li>Page number</li>
                    <li>Full URL of any pages buried deep in a website</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_p02">Throughout the process of taking notes, be scrupulous about making sure you have correctly attributed each idea to its source. Always include source information so you know exactly which ideas came from which sources. Use quotation marks to set off any words for phrases taken directly from the original text. If you add your own responses and ideas, make sure they are distinct from ideas you quoted or paraphrased.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_p03">Finally, make sure your notes accurately reflect the content of the original text. Make sure quoted material is copied verbatim. If you omit words from a quotation, use ellipses to show the omission and make sure the omission does not change the author’s meaning. Paraphrase ideas carefully, and check your paraphrased notes against the original text to make sure that you have restated the author’s ideas accurately in your own words.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Use a System That Works for You</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s04_p01">There are several formats you can use to take notes. No technique is necessarily better than the others—it is more important to choose a format you are comfortable using. Choosing the format that works best for you will ensure your notes are organized, complete, and accurate. Consider implementing one of these formats when you begin taking notes:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s04_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use index cards.</strong> This traditional format involves writing each note on a separate index card. It takes more time than copying and pasting into an electronic document, which encourages you to be selective in choosing which ideas to record. Recording notes on separate cards makes it easy to later organize your notes according to major topics. Some writers color-code their cards to make them still more organized.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use note-taking software.</strong> Word-processing and office software packages often include different types of note-taking software. Although you may need to set aside some time to learn the software, this method combines the speed of typing with the same degree of organization associated with handwritten note cards.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Maintain a research notebook.</strong> Instead of using index cards or electronic note cards, you may wish to keep a notebook or electronic folder, allotting a few pages (or one file) for each of your sources. This method makes it easy to create a separate column or section of the document where you add your responses to the information you encounter in your research.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Annotate your sources.</strong> This method involves making handwritten notes in the margins of sources that you have printed or photocopied. If using electronic sources, you can make comments within the source document. For example, you might add comment boxes to a PDF version of an article. This method works best for experienced researchers who have already thought a great deal about the topic because it can be difficult to organize your notes later when starting your draft.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s04_p02">Choose one of the methods from the list to use for taking notes. Continue gathering sources and taking notes. In the next section, you will learn strategies for organizing and synthesizing the information you have found.</p>
