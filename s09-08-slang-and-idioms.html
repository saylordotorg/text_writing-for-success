    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s08_p01">Words are the basis of how a reader or listener judges you, the writer and speaker. When you write an academic paper or speak in a business interview, you want to be sure to choose your words carefully. In our casual, everyday talk, we often use a lot of “ums,” “likes,” “yeahs,” and so on. This everyday language is not appropriate for formal contexts, such as academic papers and business interviews. You should switch between different ways of speaking and writing depending on whether the context is formal or informal.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch05_s08_s01_p02">What do you notice about the previous paragraph? You might notice that the language sounds informal, or casual, like someone might talk with a friend or family member. The paragraph also uses a lot of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">slang</a><span class="glossdef">Informal words that are considered nonstandard English.</span></span>. Slang is a type of language that is informal and playful. It often changes over time. The slang of the past is different than the slang of today, but some slang has carried over into the present. Slang also varies by region and culture. The important thing to understand is that slang is casual talk, and you should avoid using it in formal contexts. There are literally thousands of slang words and expressions. <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch05_s08_s01_t01">Table 5.17 "Slang Expressions"</a> explains just a few of the more common terms.</p>
