    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p01">We have addressed American Psychological Association (APA) style, as well as the importance of giving credit where credit is due, so now let’s turn our attention to the formatting and citation style of the Modern Language Association, known as MLA style.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">MLA style</a><span class="glossdef">Modern Language Association style, or MLA, is often used in the liberal arts and humanities. It provides a uniform framework for the manuscript and parenthetical, or in-text, citations. It also provides the framework for the works cited area for listing references at the end of the essay.</span></span> is often used in the liberal arts and humanities. Like APA style, it provides a uniform framework for consistency across a document in several areas. MLA style provides a format for the manuscript text and parenthetical citations, or in-text citations. It also provides the framework for the works cited area for references at the end of the essay. MLA style emphasizes brevity and clarity. As a student writer, it is to your advantage to be familiar with both major styles, and this section will outline the main points of MLA as well as offer specific examples of commonly used references. Remember that your writing represents you in your absence. The correct use of a citation style demonstrates your attention to detail and ability to produce a scholarly work in an acceptable style, and it can help prevent the appearance or accusations of plagiarism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p03">If you are taking an English, art history, or music appreciation class, chances are that you will be asked to write an essay in MLA format. One common question goes something like “What’s the difference?” referring to APA and MLA style, and it deserves our consideration. The liberal arts and humanities often reflect works of creativity that come from individual and group effort, but they may adapt, change, or build on previous creative works. The inspiration to create something new, from a song to a music video, may contain elements of previous works. Drawing on your fellow artists and authors is part of the creative process, and so is giving credit where credit is due.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p04">A reader interested in your subject wants not only to read what you wrote but also to be aware of the works that you used to create it. Readers want to examine your sources to see if you know your subject, to see if you missed anything, or if you offer anything new and interesting. Your new or up-to-date sources may offer the reader additional insight on the subject being considered. It also demonstrates that you, as the author, are up-to-date on what is happening in the field or on the subject. Giving credit where it is due enhances your credibility, and the MLA style offers a clear format to use.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p05">Uncredited work that is incorporated into your own writing is considered plagiarism. In the professional world, plagiarism results in loss of credibility and often compensation, including future opportunities. In a classroom setting, plagiarism results in a range of sanctions, from loss of a grade to expulsion from a school or university. In both professional and academic settings, the penalties are severe. MLA offers artists and authors a systematic style of reference, again giving credit where credit is due, to protect MLA users from accusations of plagiarism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p06">MLA style uses a citation in the body of the essay that links to the works cited page at the end. The in-text citation is offset with parentheses, clearly calling attention to itself for the reader. The reference to the author or title is like a signal to the reader that information was incorporated from a separate source. It also provides the reader with information to then turn to the works cited section of your essay (at the end) where they can find the complete reference. If you follow the MLA style, and indicate your source both in your essay and in the works cited section, you will prevent the possibility of plagiarism. If you follow the MLA guidelines, pay attention to detail, and clearly indicate your sources, then this approach to formatting and citation offers a proven way to demonstrate your respect for other authors and artists.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Five Reasons to Use MLA Style</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch13_s04_l02">
            <li>To demonstrate your ability to present a professional, academic essay in the correct style</li>
            <li>To gain credibility and authenticity for your work</li>
            <li>To enhance the ability of the reader to locate information discussed in your essay</li>
            <li>To give credit where credit is due and prevent plagiarism</li>
            <li>To get a good grade or demonstrate excellence in your writing</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p07">Before we transition to specifics, please consider one word of caution: consistency. If you are instructed to use the MLA style and need to indicate a date, you have options. For example, you could use an international or a US style:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_l03">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">International style:</strong> 18 May 1980 (day/month/year)</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">US style:</strong> May 18, 1980 (month/day/year)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p08">If you are going to the US style, be consistent in its use. You’ll find you have the option on page 83 of the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</em>, 7th edition. You have many options when writing in English as the language itself has several conventions, or acceptable ways of writing particular parts of speech or information. For example, on the next page our <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> addresses the question:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p09">Which convention is preferred in MLA style:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable" id="fresh-ch13_s04_l04">
            <li>twentieth century</li>
            <li>Twentieth Century</li>
            <li>20th century</li>
            <li>20th Century</li>
        </ol>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p10">You are welcome to look in the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> and see there is one preferred style or convention (you will also find the answer at end of this section marked by an asterisk [*]). Now you may say to yourself that you won’t write that term and it may be true, but you will come to a term or word that has more than one way it can be written. In that case, what convention is acceptable in MLA style? This is where the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> serves as an invaluable resource. Again, your attention to detail and the professional presentation of your work are aspects of learning to write in an academic setting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p11">Now let’s transition from a general discussion on the advantages of MLA style to what we are required to do to write a standard academic essay. We will first examine a general “to do” list, then review a few “do not” suggestions, and finally take a tour through a sample of MLA features. Links to sample MLA papers are located at the end of this section.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s01_p01">Depending on your field of study, you may sometimes write research papers in either APA or MLA style. Recognize that each has its advantages and preferred use in fields and disciplines. Learn to write and reference in both styles with proficiency.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Title Block Format</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s02_p01">You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and your title block (not a separate title page; just a section at the top of the first page) makes an impression on the reader. If correctly formatted with each element of information in its proper place, form, and format, it says to the reader that you mean business, that you are a professional, and that you take your work seriously, so it should, in turn, be seriously considered. Your title block in MLA style contributes to your credibility. Remember that your writing represents you in your absence, and the title block is the tailored suit or outfit that represents you best. That said, sometimes a separate title page is necessary, but it is best both to know how to properly format a title block or page in MLA style and to ask your instructor if it is included as part of the assignment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s03_p01">Make sure you indent five spaces (from the left margin). You’ll see that the indent offsets the beginning of a new paragraph.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Parenthetical Citations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s05_p01">You must cite your sources as you use them. In the same way that a table or figure should be located right next to the sentence that discusses it (see the previous example), parenthetical citations, or citations enclosed in parenthesis that appear in the text, are required. You need to cite all your information. If someone else wrote it, said it, drew it, demonstrated it, or otherwise expressed it, you need to cite it. The exception to this statement is common, widespread knowledge. For example, if you search online for MLA resources, and specifically MLA sample papers, you will find many similar discussions on MLA style. MLA is a style and cannot be copyrighted because it is a style, but the seventh edition of the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> can be copyright protected. If you reference a specific page in that handbook, you need to indicate it. If you write about a general MLA style issue that is commonly covered or addressed in multiple sources, you do not. When in doubt, reference the specific resource you used to write your essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s05_p02">Your in-text, or parenthetical, citations should do the following:</p>
