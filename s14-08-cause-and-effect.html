        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Cause and Effect in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s01_p01">It is often considered human nature to ask, “why?” and “how?” We want to know how our child got sick so we can better prevent it from happening in the future, or why our colleague a pay raise because we want one as well. We want to know how much money we will save over the long term if we buy a hybrid car. These examples identify only a few of the relationships we think about in our lives, but each shows the importance of understanding cause and effect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s01_p02">A cause is something that produces an event or condition; an effect is what results from an event or condition. The purpose of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cause-and-effect essay</a><span class="glossdef">An essay that tries to determine how various phenomena are related.</span></span> is to determine how various phenomena relate in terms of origins and results. Sometimes the connection between cause and effect is clear, but often determining the exact relationship between the two is very difficult. For example, the following effects of a cold may be easily identifiable: a sore throat, runny nose, and a cough. But determining the cause of the sickness can be far more difficult. A number of causes are possible, and to complicate matters, these possible causes could have combined to cause the sickness. That is, more than one cause may be responsible for any given effect. Therefore, cause-and-effect discussions are often complicated and frequently lead to debates and arguments.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s01_p03">Use the complex nature of cause and effect to your advantage. Often it is not necessary, or even possible, to find the exact cause of an event or to name the exact effect. So, when formulating a thesis, you can claim one of a number of causes or effects to be the primary, or main, cause or effect. As soon as you claim that one cause or one effect is more crucial than the others, you have developed a thesis.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Structure of a Cause-and-Effect Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s02_p01">The cause-and-effect essay opens with a general introduction to the topic, which then leads to a thesis that states the main cause, main effect, or various causes and effects of a condition or event.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s02_p02">The cause-and-effect essay can be organized in one of the following two primary ways:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s02_l01">
            <li>Start with the cause and then talk about the effects.</li>
            <li>Start with the effect and then talk about the causes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s02_p03">For example, if your essay were on childhood obesity, you could start by talking about the effect of childhood obesity and then discuss the cause or you could start the same essay by talking about the cause of childhood obesity and then move to the effect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s02_p04">Regardless of which structure you choose, be sure to explain each element of the essay fully and completely. Explaining complex relationships requires the full use of evidence, such as scientific studies, expert testimony, statistics, and anecdotes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s02_p05">Because cause-and-effect essays determine how phenomena are linked, they make frequent use of certain words and phrases that denote such linkage. See <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s08_s02_t01">Table 10.4 "Phrases of Causation"</a> for examples of such terms.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s02_p07">Be careful of resorting to empty speculation. In writing, speculation amounts to unsubstantiated guessing. Writers are particularly prone to such trappings in cause-and-effect arguments due to the complex nature of finding links between phenomena. Be sure to have clear evidence to support the claims that you make.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s03_p01">Choose an event or condition that you think has an interesting cause-and-effect relationship. Introduce your topic in an engaging way. End your introduction with a thesis that states the main cause, the main effect, or both.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s03_p02">Organize your essay by starting with either the cause-then-effect structure or the effect-then-cause structure. Within each section, you should clearly explain and support the causes and effects using a full range of evidence. If you are writing about multiple causes or multiple effects, you may choose to sequence either in terms of order of importance. In other words, order the causes from least to most important (or vice versa), or order the effects from least important to most important (or vice versa).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s03_p03">Use the phrases of causation when trying to forge connections between various events or conditions. This will help organize your ideas and orient the reader. End your essay with a conclusion that summarizes your main points and reinforces your thesis. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch15#fresh-ch15">Chapter 15 "Readings: Examples of Essays"</a> to read a sample cause-and-effect essay.</p>
