    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_p01">Just as a mason uses bricks to build sturdy homes, writers use words to build successful documents. Consider the construction of a building. Builders need to use tough, reliable materials to build a solid and structurally sound skyscraper. From the foundation to the roof and every floor in between, every part is necessary. Writers need to use strong, meaningful words from the first sentence to the last and in every sentence in between.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_p02">You already know many words that you use everyday as part of your writing and speaking <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vocabulary</a><span class="glossdef">A collection of spoken and written words used by individuals or groups.</span></span>. You probably also know that certain words fit better in certain situations. Letters, e-mails, and even quickly jotted grocery lists require the proper selection of vocabulary. Imagine you are writing a grocery list to purchase the ingredients for a recipe but accidentally write down cilantro when the recipe calls for parsley. Even though cilantro and parsley look remarkably alike, each produces a very different effect in food. This seemingly small error could radically alter the flavor of your dish!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_p03">Having a solid everyday vocabulary will help you while writing, but learning new words and avoiding common word errors will make a real impression on your readers. Experienced writers know that deliberate, careful word selection and usage can lead to more polished, more meaningful work. This chapter covers word choice and vocabulary-building strategies that will improve your writing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Commonly Confused Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Some words in English cause trouble for speakers and writers because these words share a similar pronunciation, meaning, or spelling with another word. These words are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commonly confused words</a><span class="glossdef">Words that share a similar pronunciation, meaning, or spelling.</span></span>. For example, read aloud the following sentences containing the commonly confused words <em class="emphasis">new</em> and <em class="emphasis">knew</em>:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_p02">I liked her <em class="emphasis">new</em> sweater.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_p03">I <em class="emphasis">knew</em> she would wear that sweater today.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s01_s01_p04">These words may sound alike when spoken, but they carry entirely different usages and meanings. <em class="emphasis">New</em> is an adjective that describes the sweater, and <em class="emphasis">knew</em> is the past tense of the verb <em class="emphasis">to know</em>.
