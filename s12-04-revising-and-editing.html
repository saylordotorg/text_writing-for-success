    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_p01">Revising and editing are the two tasks you undertake to significantly improve your essay. Both are very important elements of the writing process. You may think that a completed first draft means little improvement is needed. However, even experienced writers need to improve their drafts and rely on peers during revising and editing. You may know that athletes miss catches, fumble balls, or overshoot goals. Dancers forget steps, turn too slowly, or miss beats. For both athletes and dancers, the more they practice, the stronger their performance will become. Web designers seek better images, a more clever design, or a more appealing background for their web pages. Writing has the same capacity to profit from improvement and revision.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s01_p02">How do you get the best out of your revisions and editing? Here are some strategies that writers have developed to look at their first drafts from a fresh perspective. Try them over the course of this semester; then keep using the ones that bring results.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s01_l02">
                <li>Take a break. You are proud of what you wrote, but you might be too close to it to make changes. Set aside your writing for a few hours or even a day until you can look at it objectively.</li>
                <li>Ask someone you trust for feedback and constructive criticism.</li>
                <li>Pretend you are one of your readers. Are you satisfied or dissatisfied? Why?</li>
                <li>Use the resources that your college provides. Find out where your school’s writing lab is located and ask about the assistance they provide online and in person.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s01_p03">Many people hear the words <em class="emphasis">critic</em>, <em class="emphasis">critical</em>, and <em class="emphasis">criticism</em> and pick up only negative vibes that provoke feelings that make them blush, grumble, or shout. However, as a writer and a thinker, you need to learn to be critical of yourself in a positive way and have high expectations for your work. You also need to train your eye and trust your ability to fix what needs fixing. For this, you need to teach yourself where to look.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s02_p01">Following your outline closely offers you a reasonable guarantee that your writing will stay on purpose and not drift away from the controlling idea. However, when writers are rushed, are tired, or cannot find the right words, their writing may become less than they want it to be. Their writing may no longer be clear and concise, and they may be adding information that is not needed to develop the main idea.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s02_p03">Reading your writing aloud will often help you find problems with unity and coherence. Listen for the clarity and flow of your ideas. Identify places where you find yourself confused, and write a note to yourself about possible fixes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s02_s01_p01">Sometimes writers get caught up in the moment and cannot resist a good digression. Even though you might enjoy such detours when you chat with friends, unplanned digressions usually harm a piece of writing.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s02_s01_p02">Mariah stayed close to her outline when she drafted the three body paragraphs of her essay she tentatively titled “Digital Technology: The Newest and the Best at What Price?” But a recent shopping trip for an HDTV upset her enough that she digressed from the main topic of her third paragraph and included comments about the sales staff at the electronics store she visited. When she revised her essay, she deleted the off-topic sentences that affected the unity of the paragraph.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s02_s01_p03">Read the following paragraph twice, the first time without Mariah’s changes, and the second time with them.</p>

You may follow this same practice during many stages of the writing process.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s02_s01_p07">Many companies hire copyeditors and proofreaders to help them produce the cleanest possible final drafts of large writing projects. Copyeditors are responsible for suggesting revisions and style changes; proofreaders check documents for any errors in capitalization, spelling, and punctuation that have crept in. Many times, these tasks are done on a freelance basis, with one freelancer working for a variety of clients.</p>

Other writers unleash a lot of words in order to get out all that they feel they need to say. Do either of these composing styles match your style? Or is your composing style somewhere in between? No matter which description best fits you, the first draft of almost every piece of writing, no matter its author, can be made clearer and more concise.</p>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid language that is overly casual.</strong> Write about “men and women” rather than “girls and guys” unless you are trying to create a specific effect. A formal tone calls for formal language.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_p01">After working so closely with a piece of writing, writers often need to step back and ask for a more objective reader. What writers most need is feedback from readers who can respond only to the words on the page. When they are ready, writers show their drafts to someone they respect and who can give an honest response about its strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_p02">You, too, can ask a peer to read your draft when it is ready. After evaluating the feedback and assessing what is most helpful, the reader’s feedback will help you when you revise your draft.

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_p14">One of the reasons why word-processing programs build in a reviewing feature is that workgroups have become a common feature in many businesses. Writing is often collaborative, and the members of a workgroup and their supervisors often critique group members’ work and offer feedback that will lead to a better final product.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_s01_p01">The purpose of peer feedback is to receive constructive criticism of your essay. Your peer reviewer is your first real audience, and you have the opportunity to learn what confuses and delights a reader so that you can improve your work before sharing the final draft with a wider audience (or your intended audience).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_s01_p02">It may not be necessary to incorporate every recommendation your peer reviewer makes. However, if you start to observe a pattern in the responses you receive from peer reviewers, you might want to take that feedback into consideration in future assignments. For example, if you read consistent comments about a need for more research, then you may want to consider including more research in future assignments.</p>

In this situation, you may receive feedback from readers who do not understand the assignment or who lack your involvement with and enthusiasm for it.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_s01_s01_p02">You need to evaluate the responses you receive according to two important criteria:</p>

                    <li>Determine if the feedback supports the purpose of the assignment.</li>
                    <li>Determine if the suggested revisions are appropriate to the audience.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s04_s01_s01_p03">Then, using these standards, accept or reject revision feedback.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p01">If you have been incorporating each set of revisions as Mariah has, you have produced multiple drafts of your writing. So far, all your changes have been content changes. Perhaps with the help of peer feedback, you have made sure that you sufficiently supported your ideas. You have checked for problems with unity and coherence. You have examined your essay for word choice, revising to cut unnecessary words and to replace weak wording with specific and appropriate wording.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p02">The next step after revising the content is editing. When you edit, you examine the surface features of your text. You examine your spelling, grammar, usage, and punctuation. You also make sure you use the proper format when creating your finished assignment.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p03">Editing often takes time. Budgeting time into the writing process allows you to complete additional edits after revising. Editing and proofreading your writing helps you create a finished work that represents your best efforts. Here are a few more tips to remember about your readers:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_l01">
                <li>Readers do not notice correct spelling, but they <em class="emphasis">do</em> notice misspellings.</li>
                <li>Readers look past your sentences to get to your ideas—unless the sentences are awkward, poorly constructed, and frustrating to read.</li>
                <li>Readers notice when every sentence has the same rhythm as every other sentence, with no variety.</li>
                <li>Readers do not cheer when you use <em class="emphasis">there</em>, <em class="emphasis">their</em>, and <em class="emphasis">they’re</em> correctly, but they notice when you do not.</li>
                <li>Readers will notice the care with which you handled your assignment and your attention to detail in the delivery of an error-free document..</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p04">The first section of this book offers a useful review of grammar, mechanics, and usage. Use it to help you eliminate major errors in your writing and refine your understanding of the conventions of language. Do not hesitate to ask for help, too, from peer tutors in your academic department or in the college’s writing lab. In the meantime, use the checklist to help you edit your writing.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p09">Be careful about relying too much on spelling checkers and grammar checkers. A spelling checker cannot recognize that you meant to write <em class="emphasis">principle</em> but wrote <em class="emphasis">principal</em> instead. A grammar checker often queries constructions that are perfectly correct. The program does not understand your meaning; it makes its check against a general set of formulas that might not apply in each instance. If you use a grammar checker, accept the suggestions that make sense, but consider why the suggestions came up.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p10">Proofreading requires patience; it is very easy to read past a mistake. Set your paper aside for at least a few hours, if not a day or more, so your mind will rest. Some professional proofreaders read a text backward so they can concentrate on spelling and punctuation. Another helpful technique is to slowly read a paper aloud, paying attention to every word, letter, and punctuation mark.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_p11">If you need additional proofreading help, ask a reliable friend, a classmate, or a peer tutor to make a final pass on your paper to look for anything you missed.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_s01_p01">Remember to use proper format when creating your finished assignment. Sometimes an instructor, a department, or a college will require students to follow specific instructions on titles, margins, page numbers, or the location of the writer’s name. These requirements may be more detailed and rigid for research projects and term papers, which often observe the American Psychological Association (APA) or Modern Language Association (MLA) style guides, especially when citations of sources are included.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s04_s05_s01_p02">To ensure the format is correct and follows any specific instructions, make a final check before you submit an assignment.</p>
