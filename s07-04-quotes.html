            <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s04_s01_p04">Most word processsing software is designed to catch errors in grammar, spelling, and punctuation. While this can be a useful tool, it is better to be well acquainted with the rules of punctuation than to leave the thinking to the computer. Properly punctuated writing will convey your meaning clearly. Consider the subtle shifts in meaning in the following sentences:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
                <li>The client said he thought our manuscript was garbage.</li>
                <li>The client said, “He thought our manuscript was garbage.”</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s04_s01_p07">The first sentence reads as an indirect quote in which the client does not like the manuscript. But did he actually use the word “garbage”? (This would be alarming!) Or has the speaker paraphrased (and exaggerated) the client’s words?</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s04_s01_p08">The second sentence reads as a direct quote from the client. But who is “he” in this sentence? Is it a third party?</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s04_s01_p09">Word processing software would not catch this because the sentences are not grammatically incorrect. However, the meanings of the sentences are not the same. Understanding punctuation will help you write what you mean, and in this case, could save a lot of confusion around the office!</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s04_s01_s01_p01">Quotation marks show readers another person’s exact words. Often, you will want to identify who is speaking. You can do this at the beginning, middle, or end of the quote. Notice the use of commas and capitalized words.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s04_s02_p04">In many businesses, the difference between exact wording and a paraphrase is extremely important. For legal purposes, or for the purposes of doing a job correctly, it can be important to know exactly what the client, customer, or supervisor said. Sometimes, important details can be lost when instructions are paraphrased. Use quotes to indicate exact words where needed, and let your coworkers know the source of the quotation (client, customer, peer, etc.).</p>
