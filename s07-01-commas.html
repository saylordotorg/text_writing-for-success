    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s01_p01">One of the punctuation clues to reading you may encounter is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comma</a><span class="glossdef">A punctuation mark that tells the reader when to pause or when a word is part of a list.</span></span>. The comma is a punctuation mark that indicates a pause in a sentence or a separation of things in a list. Commas can be used in a variety of ways. Look at some of the following sentences to see how you might use a comma when writing a sentence.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s01_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Introductory word:</strong> Personally, I think the practice is helpful.</li>

        <li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s01_s01_p01">You may notice a comma that appears near the beginning of the sentence, usually after a word or phrase. This comma lets the reader know where the introductory word or phrase ends and the main sentence begins.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s01_s02_p01">When you want to list several nouns in a sentence, you separate each word with a comma. This allows the reader to pause after each item and identify which words are included in the grouping. When you list items in a sentence, put a comma after each noun, then add the word <em class="emphasis">and</em> before the last item. However, you do not need to include a comma after the last item.</p>

                <li>It was a cool crisp autumn day when the group set out. They needed to cover several miles before they made camp so they walked at a brisk pace. The leader of the group Garth kept checking his watch and their GPS location. Isabelle Raoul and Maggie took turns carrying the equipment while Carrie took notes about the wildlife they saw. As a result no one noticed the darkening sky until the first drops of rain splattered on their faces.</li>
                <li>Please have your report complete and filed by April 15 2010. In your submission letter please include your contact information the position you are applying for and two people we can contact as references.

                <li>Punctuation marks provide visual cues to readers to tell them how to read a sentence. Punctuation marks convey meaning.</li>
                <li>Commas indicate a pause or a list in a sentence.</li>
                <li>A comma should be used after an introductory word to separate this word from the main sentence.</li>
                <li>A comma comes after each noun in a list. The word <em class="emphasis">and</em> is added before the last noun, which is not followed by a comma.</li>
                <li>A comma comes after every coordinating adjective except for the last adjective.</li>
                <li>Commas can be used to separate the two independent clauses in compound sentences as long as a conjunction follows the comma.</li>
                <li>Commas are used to separate interrupting words from the rest of the sentence.</li>
                <li>When you write the date, you add a comma between the day and the year. You also add a comma after the year if the sentence continues after the date.</li>
                <li>When they are used in a sentence, addresses have commas after the street address, and the city. If a sentence continues after the address, a comma comes after the zip code.</li>
                <li>When you write a letter, you use commas in your greeting at the beginning and in your closing at the end of your letter.</li>
