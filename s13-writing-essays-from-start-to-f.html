    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_p01">Have you ever known a person who was not very good at telling stories? You probably had trouble following his train of thought as he jumped around from point to point, either being too brief in places that needed further explanation or providing too many details on a meaningless element. Maybe he told the end of the story first, then moved to the beginning and later added details to the middle. His ideas were probably scattered, and the story did not flow very well. When the story was over, you probably had many questions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_p02">Just as a personal anecdote can be a disorganized mess, an essay can fall into the same trap of being out of order and confusing. That is why writers need a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis statement</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay. A thesis statement is often one sentence long and states the writer’s point of view.</span></span> to provide a specific focus for their essay and to organize what they are about to discuss in the body.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_p03">Just like a topic sentence summarizes a single paragraph, the thesis statement summarizes an entire essay. It tells the reader the point you want to make in your essay, while the essay itself supports that point. It is like a signpost that signals the essay’s destination. You should form your thesis before you begin to organize an essay, but you may find that it needs revision as the essay develops.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Elements of a Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_p01">For every essay you write, you must focus on a central idea. This idea stems from a topic you have chosen or been assigned or from a question your teacher has asked. It is not enough merely to discuss a general topic or simply answer a question with a yes or no. You have to form a specific opinion, and then articulate that into a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controlling idea</a><span class="glossdef">The main idea that guides the content of an essay; the idea upon which a thesis statement is built.</span></span>—the main idea upon which you build your thesis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_p02">Remember that a thesis is not the topic itself, but rather your interpretation of the question or subject. For whatever topic your professor gives you, you must ask yourself, “What do I want to say about it?” Asking and then answering this question is vital to forming a thesis that is precise, forceful and confident.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_p03">A thesis is one sentence long and appears toward the end of your introduction. It is specific and focuses on one to three points of a single idea—points that are able to be demonstrated in the body. It forecasts the content of the essay and suggests how you will organize your information. Remember that a thesis statement does not summarize an issue but rather dissects it.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">A Strong Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p01">A strong thesis statement contains the following qualities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Specificity.</strong> A thesis statement must concentrate on a specific area of a general topic. As you may recall, the creation of a thesis statement begins when you choose a broad subject and then narrow down its parts until you pinpoint a specific aspect of that topic. For example, health care is a broad topic, but a proper thesis statement would focus on a specific area of that topic, such as options for individuals without health care coverage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Precision.</strong> A strong thesis statement must be precise enough to allow for a coherent argument and to remain focused on the topic. If the specific topic is options for individuals without health care coverage, then your precise thesis statement must make an exact claim about it, such as that limited options exist for those who are uninsured by their employers. You must further pinpoint what you are going to discuss regarding these limited effects, such as whom they affect and what the cause is.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ability to be argued.</strong> A thesis statement must present a relevant and specific argument. A factual statement often is not considered arguable. Be sure your thesis statement contains a point of view that can be supported with evidence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ability to be demonstrated.</strong> For any claim you make in your thesis, you must be able to provide reasons and examples for your opinion. You can rely on personal observations in order to do this, or you can consult outside sources to demonstrate that what you assert is valid. A worthy argument is backed by examples and details.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Forcefulness.</strong> A thesis statement that is forceful shows readers that you are, in fact, making an argument. The tone is assertive and takes a stance that others might oppose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Confidence.</strong> In addition to using force in your thesis statement, you must also use confidence in your claim. Phrases such as <em class="emphasis">I feel</em> or <em class="emphasis">I believe</em> actually weaken the readers’ sense of your confidence because these phrases imply that you are the only person who feels the way you do. In other words, your stance has insufficient backing. Taking an authoritative stance on the matter persuades your readers to have faith in your argument and open their minds to what you have to say.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s01_s01_p08">Even in a personal essay that allows the use of first person, your thesis should not contain phrases such as <em class="emphasis">in my opinion</em> or <em class="emphasis">I believe</em>. These statements reduce your credibility and weaken your argument. Your opinion is more convincing when you use a firm attitude.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p01">You can cut down on irrelevant aspects and revise your thesis by taking the following steps:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p04">The revised thesis makes a more specific statement about success and what it means to work hard. The original includes too broad a range of people and does not define exactly what success entails. By replacing those general words like <em class="emphasis">people</em> and <em class="emphasis">work hard</em>, the writer can better focus his or her research and gain more direction in his or her writing.</p>
                </li>

Readers bring all sorts of backgrounds and perspectives to the reading process and would need clarification for a word so vague. This expression may also be too informal for the selected audience. By asking questions, the writer can devise a more precise and appropriate explanation for <em class="emphasis">joke</em>. The writer should ask himself or herself questions similar to the 5WH questions. (See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> for more information on the 5WH questions.) By incorporating the answers to these questions into a thesis statement, the writer more accurately defines his or her stance, which will better guide the writing of the essay.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_p02">Remember that a worthy argument is backed by examples. In order to construct a valid argument, good writers conduct lots of background research and take careful notes.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">In order to fulfill the requirements of good primary support, the information you choose must meet the following standards:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be specific.</strong> The main points you make about your thesis and the examples you use to expand on those points need to be specific. Use specific examples to provide the evidence and to build upon your general ideas. These types of examples give your reader something narrow to focus on, and if used properly, they leave little doubt about your claim. General examples, while they convey the necessary information, are not nearly as compelling or useful in writing because they are too obvious and typical.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be relevant to the thesis.</strong> Primary support is considered strong when it relates directly to the thesis. Primary support should show, explain, or prove your main argument without delving into irrelevant details. When faced with lots of information that could be used to prove your thesis, you may think you need to include it all in your body paragraphs. But effective writers resist the temptation to lose focus. Choose your examples wisely by making sure they directly connect to your thesis.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be detailed.</strong> Remember that your thesis, while specific, should not be very detailed. The body paragraphs are where you develop the discussion that a thorough essay requires. Using detailed support shows readers that you have considered all the facts and chosen only the most precise details to enhance your point of view.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p04">When you support your thesis, you are revealing evidence. Evidence includes anything that can help support your stance. The following are the kinds of evidence you will encounter as you conduct your research:</p>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Facts.</strong> Facts are the best kind of evidence to use because they often cannot be disputed. They can support your stance by providing background information on or a solid foundation for your point of view. However, some facts may still need explanation. For example, the sentence “The most populated state in the United States is California” is a pure fact, but it may require some explanation to make it relevant to your specific argument.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Judgments.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Judgments</a><span class="glossdef">A conclusion that is inferred from the facts of a matter.</span></span> are conclusions drawn from the given facts.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Testimony.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Testimony</a><span class="glossdef">Quotations from people involved in a matter. It lends authenticity and credibility to an argument.</span></span> consists of direct quotations from either an eyewitness or an expert witness. An eyewitness is someone who has direct experience with a subject; he adds authenticity to an argument based on facts. An expert witness is a person who has extensive experience with a topic. This person studies the facts and provides commentary based on either facts or judgments, or both. An expert witness adds authority and credibility to an argument.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Personal observation.</strong> Personal observation is similar to testimony, but personal observation consists of your testimony. It reflects what you know to be true because you have experiences and have formed either opinions or judgments about them. For instance, if you are one of five children and your thesis states that being part of a large family is beneficial to a child’s social development, you could use your own experience to support your thesis.</li>

You can state it at the beginning of the body paragraph, or at the end of the paragraph, or you do not have to write it at all. This is called an implied topic sentence. An implied topic sentence lets readers form the main idea for themselves. For beginning writers, it is best to not use implied topic sentences because it makes it harder to focus your writing. Your instructor may also want to clearly identify the sentences that support your thesis. For more information on the placement of thesis statements and implied topic statements, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.</p>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p01">The method of organization you choose for your essay is just as important as its content. Without a clear organizational pattern, your reader could become confused and lose interest. The way you structure your essay helps your readers draw connections between the body and the thesis, and the structure also keeps you focused as you plan and write the essay. Choosing your organizational pattern before you outline ensures that each body paragraph works to support and develop your thesis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p02">This section covers three ways to organize body paragraphs:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_l02">
        <li>Chronological order</li>

    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p03">When you begin to draft your essay, your ideas may seem to flow from your mind in a seemingly random manner. Your readers, who bring to the table different backgrounds, viewpoints, and ideas, need you to clearly organize these ideas in order to help process and accept them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p04">A solid organizational pattern gives your ideas a path that you can follow as you develop your draft. Knowing how you will organize your paragraphs allows you to better express and analyze your thoughts. Planning the structure of your essay before you choose supporting evidence helps you conduct more effective and targeted research.</p>

When using chronological order, arrange the events in the order that they actually happened, or will happen if you are giving instructions.

These transition words guide you and your reader through the paper as you expand your thesis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p03">For example, if you are writing an essay about the history of the airline industry, you would begin with its conception and detail the essential timeline events up until present day.

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p07">When using chronological order, your introduction should indicate the information you will cover and in what order, and the introduction should also establish the relevance of the information. Your body paragraphs should then provide clear divisions or steps in chronology. You can divide your paragraphs by time (such as decades, wars, or other historical events) or by the same structure of the work you are examining (such as a line-by-line explication of a poem).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p02">Most essays move from the least to the most important point, and the paragraphs are arranged in an effort to build the essay’s strength. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to begin with your most important supporting point, such as in an essay that contains a thesis that is highly debatable. When writing a persuasive essay, it is best to begin with the most important point because it immediately captivates your readers and compels them to continue reading.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p03">For example, if you were supporting your thesis that homework is detrimental to the education of high school students, you would want to present your most convincing argument first, and then move on to the less important points for your case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p04">Some key transitional words you should use with this method of organization are <em class="emphasis">most importantly</em>, <em class="emphasis">almost as importantly</em>, <em class="emphasis">just as importantly</em>, and <em class="emphasis">finally</em>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_p06">If you have trouble coming up with a provocative statement for your opening, it is a good idea to use a relevant, attention-grabbing quote about your topic. Use a search engine to find statements made by historical or significant figures about your subject.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_p07">In your job field, you may be required to write a speech for an event, such as an awards banquet or a dedication ceremony. The introduction of a speech is similar to an essay because you have a limited amount of space to attract your audience’s attention. Using the same techniques, such as a provocative quote or an interesting statistic, is an effective way to engage your listeners. Using the funnel approach also introduces your audience to your topic and then presents your main idea in a logical manner.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing a Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_p01">It is not unusual to want to rush when you approach your conclusion, and even experienced writers may fade. But what good writers remember is that it is vital to put just as much attention into the conclusion as in the rest of the essay. After all, a hasty ending can undermine an otherwise strong essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_p02">A conclusion that does not correspond to the rest of your essay, has loose ends, or is unorganized can unsettle your readers and raise doubts about the entire essay. However, if you have worked hard to write the introduction and body, your conclusion can often be the most logical part to compose.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Anatomy of a Strong Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p01">Keep in mind that the ideas in your conclusion must conform to the rest of your essay. In order to tie these components together, restate your thesis at the beginning of your conclusion. This helps you assemble, in an orderly fashion, all the information you have explained in the body. Repeating your thesis reminds your readers of the major arguments you have been trying to prove and also indicates that your essay is drawing to a close. A strong conclusion also reviews your main points and emphasizes the importance of the topic.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p02">The construction of the conclusion is similar to the introduction, in which you make general introductory statements and then present your thesis. The difference is that in the conclusion you first <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paraphrase</a><span class="glossdef">To restate ideas or information from sources using one’s own words and sentence structures.</span></span>, or state in different words, your thesis and then follow up with general concluding remarks. These sentences should progressively broaden the focus of your thesis and maneuver your readers out of the essay.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p03">Many writers like to end their essays with a final emphatic statement. This strong closing statement will cause your readers to continue thinking about the implications of your essay; it will make your conclusion, and thus your essay, more memorable. Another powerful technique is to challenge your readers to make a change in either their thoughts or their actions. Challenging your readers to see the subject through new eyes is a powerful way to ease yourself and your readers out of the essay.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p04">When closing your essay, do not expressly state that you are drawing to a close. Relying on statements such as <em class="emphasis">in conclusion</em>, <em class="emphasis">it is clear that</em>, <em class="emphasis">as you can see</em>, or <em class="emphasis">in summation</em> is unnecessary and can be considered trite.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p05">It is wise to avoid doing any of the following in your conclusion:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>Introducing new material</li>
                    <li>Contradicting your thesis</li>
                    <li>Changing your thesis</li>
                    <li>Using apologies or disclaimers</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p06">Introducing new material in your conclusion has an unsettling effect on your reader. When you raise new points, you make your reader want more information, which you could not possibly provide in the limited space of your final paragraph.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p07">Contradicting or changing your thesis statement causes your readers to think that you do not actually have a conviction about your topic. After all, you have spent several paragraphs adhering to a singular point of view. When you change sides or open up your point of view in the conclusion, your reader becomes less inclined to believe your original argument.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p08">By apologizing for your opinion or stating that you know it is tough to digest, you are in fact admitting that even you know what you have discussed is irrelevant or unconvincing. You do not want your readers to feel this way. Effective writers stand by their thesis statement and do not stray from it.</p>
