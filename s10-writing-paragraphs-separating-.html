    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_p01">Imagine reading one long block of text, with each idea blurring into the next. Even if you are reading a thrilling novel or an interesting news article, you will likely lose interest in what the author has to say very quickly. During the writing process, it is helpful to position yourself as a reader. Ask yourself whether you can focus easily on each point you make. One technique that effective writers use is to begin a fresh paragraph for each new idea they introduce.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_p02">Paragraphs separate ideas into logical, manageable chunks. One paragraph focuses on only one main idea and presents coherent sentences to support that one point. Because all the sentences in one paragraph support the same point, a paragraph may stand on its own. To create longer assignments and to discuss more than one point, writers group together paragraphs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_p03">Three elements shape the content of each paragraph:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_l02">
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Purpose</a><span class="glossdef">Identifies the reason(s) why a writer creates a document. The common academic purposes are summary, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.</span></span>. The reason the writer composes the paragraph.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Tone</a><span class="glossdef">Identifies a writer’s attitude toward his or her subject and audience.</span></span>. The attitude the writer conveys about the paragraph’s subject.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_p04">The assignment’s purpose, audience, and tone dictate what the paragraph covers and how it will support one main point. This section covers how purpose, audience, and tone affect reading and writing paragraphs.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Identifying Common Academic Purposes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_p01">The purpose for a piece of writing identifies the reason you write a particular document. Basically, the purpose of a piece of writing answers the question “Why?” For example, why write a play? To entertain a packed theater. Why write instructions to the babysitter? To inform him or her of your schedule and rules. Why write a letter to your congressman? To persuade him to address your community’s needs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_p02">In academic settings, the reasons for writing fulfill four main purposes: to summarize, to analyze, to synthesize, and to evaluate. You will encounter these four purposes not only as you read for your classes but also as you read for work or pleasure. Because reading and writing work together, your writing skills will improve as you read. To learn more about reading in the writing process, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_p03">Eventually, your instructors will ask you to complete assignments specifically designed to meet one of the four purposes. As you will see, the purpose for writing will guide you through each part of the paper, helping you make decisions about content and style. For now, identifying these purposes by reading paragraphs will prepare you to write individual paragraphs and to build longer assignments.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Summary Paragraphs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summary</a><span class="glossdef">A purpose for writing that condenses a long piece of writing into a smaller paragraph by extracting only the vital information. Writers use their own words to create summaries.</span></span> shrinks a large amount of information into only the essentials. You probably summarize events, books, and movies daily. Think about the last blockbuster movie you saw or the last novel you read. Chances are, at some point in a casual conversation with a friend, coworker, or classmate, you compressed all the action in a two-hour film or in a two-hundred-page book into a brief description of the major plot movements. While in conversation, you probably described the major highlights, or the main points in just a few sentences, using your own vocabulary and manner of speaking.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p02">Similarly, a summary paragraph condenses a long piece of writing into a smaller paragraph by extracting only the vital information. A summary uses only the writer’s own words. Like the summary’s purpose in daily conversation, the purpose of an academic summary paragraph is to maintain all the essential information from a longer document. Although shorter than the original piece of writing, a summary should still communicate all the key points and key support. In other words, summary paragraphs should be succinct and to the point.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">
                <img src="section_10/6b2135f4df1595577ae83e8b038ad414.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p03">A summary of the report should present all the main points and supporting details in brief. Read the following summary of the report written by a student:</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">
                <img src="section_10/8223ec890b45105eb38a49936d955b27.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s01_p04">Notice how the summary retains the key points made by the writers of the original report but omits most of the statistical data. Summaries need not contain all the specific facts and figures in the original document; they provide only an overview of the essential information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Analysis Paragraphs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p01">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A purpose for writing that separates the individual points in a piece of writing and studies how the points relate to one another.</span></span> separates complex materials in their different parts and studies how the parts relate to one another. The analysis of simple table salt, for example, would require a deconstruction of its parts—the elements sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl). Then, scientists would study how the two elements interact to create the compound NaCl, or sodium chloride, which is also called simple table salt.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p02">Analysis is not limited to the sciences, of course. An analysis paragraph in academic writing fulfills the same purpose. Instead of deconstructing compounds, academic analysis paragraphs typically deconstruct documents. An analysis takes apart a primary source (an essay, a book, an article, etc.) point by point. It communicates the main points of the document by examining individual points and identifying how the points relate to one another.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p03">Take a look at a student’s analysis of the journal report.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">
                <img src="section_10/1a86575c2ac1a7b4eb3acd16749d2d38.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s02_p04">Notice how the analysis does not simply repeat information from the original report, but considers how the points within the report relate to one another. By doing this, the student uncovers a discrepancy between the points that are backed up by statistics and those that require additional information. Analyzing a document involves a close examination of each of the individual parts and how they work together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Synthesis Paragraphs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s03_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">synthesis</a><span class="glossdef">A purpose for writing that considers the main points from one or more pieces of writing and links them together to create a new point.</span></span> combines two or more items to create an entirely new item. Consider the electronic musical instrument aptly named the synthesizer. It looks like a simple keyboard but displays a dashboard of switches, buttons, and levers. With the flip of a few switches, a musician may combine the distinct sounds of a piano, a flute, or a guitar—or any other combination of instruments—to create a new sound. The purpose of the synthesizer is to blend together the notes from individual instruments to form new, unique notes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s03_p02">The purpose of an academic synthesis is to blend individual documents into a new document. An academic synthesis paragraph considers the main points from one or more pieces of writing and links the main points together to create a new point, one not replicated in either document.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s03_p03">Take a look at a student’s synthesis of several sources about underage drinking.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">
                <img src="section_10/36b28a7d716dfcad4f513e58ba4c3218.jpg">
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s03_p04">Notice how the synthesis paragraphs consider each source and use information from each to create a new thesis. A good synthesis does not repeat information; the writer uses a variety of sources to create a new idea.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Evaluation Paragraphs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s04_p01">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">evaluation</a><span class="glossdef">A purpose for writing that communicates a writer’s opinion about a document or a topic and the justifications for that opinion.</span></span> judges the value of something and determines its worth. Evaluations in everyday experiences are often not only dictated by set standards but also influenced by opinion and prior knowledge. For example, at work, a supervisor may complete an employee evaluation by judging his subordinate’s performance based on the company’s goals. If the company focuses on improving communication, the supervisor will rate the employee’s customer service according to a standard scale. However, the evaluation still depends on the supervisor’s opinion and prior experience with the employee. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine how well the employee performs at his or her job.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s04_p02">An academic evaluation communicates your opinion, and its justifications, about a document or a topic of discussion. Evaluations are influenced by your reading of the document, your prior knowledge, and your prior experience with the topic or issue. Because an evaluation incorporates your point of view and reasons for your point of view, it typically requires more critical thinking and a combination of summary, analysis, and synthesis skills. Thus evaluation paragraphs often follow summary, analysis, and synthesis paragraphs. Read a student’s evaluation paragraph.</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s04_p03">Notice how the paragraph incorporates the student’s personal judgment within the evaluation. Evaluating a document requires prior knowledge that is often based on additional research.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Exercise 1</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s04_p05">Read the following paragraphs about four films and then identify the purpose of each paragraph.</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s04_l01">
                    <li>This film could easily have been cut down to less than two hours. By the final scene, I noticed that most of my fellow moviegoers were snoozing in their seats and were barely paying attention to what was happening on screen. Although the director sticks diligently to the book, he tries too hard to cram in all the action, which is just too ambitious for such a detail-oriented story. If you want my advice, read the book and give the movie a miss.</li>
                    <li>During the opening scene, we learn that the character Laura is adopted and that she has spent the past three years desperately trying to track down her real parents. Having exhausted all the usual options—adoption agencies, online searches, family trees, and so on—she is on the verge of giving up when she meets a stranger on a bus. The chance encounter leads to a complicated chain of events that ultimately result in Laura getting her lifelong wish. But is it really what she wants? Throughout the rest of the film, Laura discovers that sometimes the past is best left where it belongs.</li>
                    <li>To create the feeling of being gripped in a vice, the director, May Lee, uses a variety of elements to gradually increase the tension. The creepy, haunting melody that subtly enhances the earlier scenes becomes ever more insistent, rising to a disturbing crescendo toward the end of the movie. The desperation of the actors, combined with the claustrophobic atmosphere and tight camera angles create a realistic firestorm, from which there is little hope of escape. Walking out of the theater at the end feels like staggering out of a Roman dungeon.</li>
                    <li>The scene in which Campbell and his fellow prisoners assist the guards in shutting down the riot immediately strikes the viewer as unrealistic. Based on the recent reports on prison riots in both Detroit and California, it seems highly unlikely that a posse of hardened criminals will intentionally help their captors at the risk of inciting future revenge from other inmates. Instead, both news reports and psychological studies indicate that prisoners who do not actively participate in a riot will go back to their cells and avoid conflict altogether. Examples of this lack of attention to detail occur throughout the film, making it almost unbearable to watch.</li>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s01_s04_p07">Thinking about the purpose of writing a report in the workplace can help focus and structure the document. A summary should provide colleagues with a factual overview of your findings without going into too much specific detail. In contrast, an evaluation should include your personal opinion, along with supporting evidence, research, or examples to back it up. Listen for words such as <em class="emphasis">summarize</em>, <em class="emphasis">analyze</em>, <em class="emphasis">synthesize</em>, or <em class="emphasis">evaluate</em> when your boss asks you to complete a report to help determine a purpose for writing.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Identifying the Audience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p01">Imagine you must give a presentation to a group of executives in an office. Weeks before the big day, you spend time creating and rehearsing the presentation. You must make important, careful decisions not only about the content but also about your delivery. Will the presentation require technology to project figures and charts? Should the presentation define important words, or will the executives already know the terms? Should you wear your suit and dress shirt? The answers to these questions will help you develop an appropriate relationship with your audience, making them more receptive to your message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p02">Now imagine you must explain the same business concepts from your presentation to a group of high school students. Those important questions you previously answered may now require different answers. The figures and charts may be too sophisticated, and the terms will certainly require definitions. You may even reconsider your outfit and sport a more casual look. Because the audience has shifted, your presentation and delivery will shift as well to create a new relationship with the new audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p03">In these two situations, the audience—the individuals who will watch and listen to the presentation—plays a role in the development of presentation. As you prepare the presentation, you visualize the audience to anticipate their expectations and reactions. What you imagine affects the information you choose to present and how you will present it. Then, during the presentation, you meet the audience in person and discover immediately how well you perform.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p04">Although the audience for writing assignments—your readers—may not appear in person, they play an equally vital role. Even in everyday writing activities, you identify your readers’ characteristics, interests, and expectations before making decisions about what you write. In fact, thinking about audience has become so common that you may not even detect the audience-driven decisions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p05">For example, you update your status on a social networking site with the awareness of who will digitally follow the post. If you want to brag about a good grade, you may write the post to please family members. If you want to describe a funny moment, you may write with your friends’ senses of humor in mind. Even at work, you send e-mails with an awareness of an unintended receiver who could intercept the message.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p06">In other words, being aware of “invisible” readers is a skill you most likely already possess and one you rely on every day. Consider the following paragraphs. Which one would the author send to her parents? Which one would she send to her best friend?</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_n01">
            <p class="simpara">Example A</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p07">Last Saturday, I volunteered at a local hospital. The visit was fun and rewarding. I even learned how to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. Unfortunately, I think caught a cold from one of the patients. This week, I will rest in bed and drink plenty of clear fluids. I hope I am well by next Saturday to volunteer again.</p>
            <p class="simpara">Example B</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p08">OMG! You won’t believe this! My advisor forced me to do my community service hours at this hospital all weekend! We learned CPR but we did it on dummies, not even real peeps. And some kid sneezed on me and got me sick! I was so bored and sniffling all weekend; I hope I don’t have to go back next week. I def do NOT want to miss the basketball tournament!</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p09">Most likely, you matched each paragraph to its intended audience with little hesitation. Because each paragraph reveals the author’s relationship with her intended readers, you can identify the audience fairly quickly. When writing your own paragraphs, you must engage with your audience to build an appropriate relationship given your subject. Imagining your readers during each stage of the writing process will help you make decisions about your writing. Ultimately, the people you visualize will affect what and how you write.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p10">While giving a speech, you may articulate an inspiring or critical message, but if you left your hair a mess and laced up mismatched shoes, your audience would not take you seriously. They may be too distracted by your appearance to listen to your words.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p11">Similarly, grammar and sentence structure serve as the appearance of a piece of writing. Polishing your work using correct grammar will impress your readers and allow them to focus on what you have to say.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s02_p12">Because focusing on audience will enhance your writing, your process, and your finished product, you must consider the specific traits of your audience members. Use your imagination to anticipate the readers’ demographics, education, prior knowledge, and expectations.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Demographics.</strong> These measure important data about a group of people, such as their age range, their ethnicity, their religious beliefs, or their gender. Certain topics and assignments will require these kinds of considerations about your audience. For other topics and assignments, these measurements may not influence your writing in the end. Regardless, it is important to consider demographics when you begin to think about your purpose for writing.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Education.</strong> Education considers the audience’s level of schooling. If audience members have earned a doctorate degree, for example, you may need to elevate your style and use more formal language. Or, if audience members are still in college, you could write in a more relaxed style. An audience member’s major or emphasis may also dictate your writing.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prior knowledge.</strong> This refers to what the audience already knows about your topic. If your readers have studied certain topics, they may already know some terms and concepts related to the topic. You may decide whether to define terms and explain concepts based on your audience’s prior knowledge. Although you cannot peer inside the brains of your readers to discover their knowledge, you can make reasonable assumptions. For instance, a nursing major would presumably know more about health-related topics than a business major would.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Expectations.</strong> These indicate what readers will look for while reading your assignment. Readers may expect consistencies in the assignment’s appearance, such as correct grammar and traditional formatting like double-spaced lines and legible font. Readers may also have content-based expectations given the assignment’s purpose and organization. In an essay titled “The Economics of Enlightenment: The Effects of Rising Tuition,” for example, audience members may expect to read about the economic repercussions of college tuition costs.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Selecting an Appropriate Tone</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s03_p01">Tone identifies a speaker’s attitude toward a subject or another person. You may pick up a person’s tone of voice fairly easily in conversation. A friend who tells you about her weekend may speak excitedly about a fun skiing trip. An instructor who means business may speak in a low, slow voice to emphasize her serious mood. Or, a coworker who needs to let off some steam after a long meeting may crack a sarcastic joke.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s03_p02">Just as speakers transmit emotion through voice, writers can transmit through writing a range of attitudes, from excited and humorous to somber and critical. These emotions create connections among the audience, the author, and the subject, ultimately building a relationship between the audience and the text. To stimulate these connections, writers intimate their attitudes and feelings with useful devices, such as sentence structure, word choice, punctuation, and formal or informal language. Keep in mind that the writer’s attitude should always appropriately match the audience and the purpose.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s01_s03_p03">Read the following paragraph and consider the writer’s tone. How would you describe the writer’s attitude toward wildlife conservation?</p>

Human activities, including pollution, deforestation, hunting, and overpopulation, are devastating the natural environment. Without our help, many species will not survive long enough for our children to see them in the wild. Take the tiger, for example. Today, tigers occupy just 7 percent of their historical range, and many local populations are already extinct. Hunted for their beautiful pelt and other body parts, the tiger population has plummeted from one hundred thousand in 1920 to just a few thousand.

Composing an effective paragraph requires a method similar to building a house.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_p02">A strong paragraph contains three distinct components:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_l02">
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">The sentence in a paragraph that controls the point of the paragraph. A topic sentence is most often located at the beginning of a paragraph, and it makes the structure of a text and the writer’s basic arguments easy to locate and comprehend.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> The topic sentence is the main idea of the paragraph.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Body</a><span class="glossdef">The middle part of a paragraph containing supporting sentences. The body of the paragraph provides additional information about the topic sentence.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> The body is composed of the supporting sentences that develop the main point.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conclusion</a><span class="glossdef">The final sentence in a paragraph that summarizes the main point.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> The conclusion is the final sentence that summarizes the main point.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_p03">The foundation of a good paragraph is the topic sentence, which expresses the main idea of the paragraph. The topic sentence relates to the thesis, or main point, of the essay (see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a> for more information about thesis statements) and guides the reader by signposting what the paragraph is about. All the sentences in the rest of the paragraph should relate to the topic sentence.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_p04">This section covers the major components of a paragraph and examines how to develop an effective topic sentence.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Developing a Topic Sentence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Pick up any newspaper or magazine and read the first sentence of an article. Are you fairly confident that you know what the rest of the article is about? If so, you have likely read the topic sentence. An effective topic sentence combines a main idea with the writer’s personal attitude or opinion. It serves to orient the reader and provides an indication of what will follow in the rest of the paragraph. Read the following example.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p02">Creating a national set of standards for math and English education will improve student learning in many states.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p03">This topic sentence declares a favorable position for standardizing math and English education. After reading this sentence, a reader might reasonably expect the writer to provide supporting details and facts as to why standardizing math and English education might improve student learning in many states. If the purpose of the essay is actually to evaluate education in only one particular state, or to discuss math or English education specifically, then the topic sentence is misleading.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p04">When writing a draft of an essay, allow a friend or colleague to read the opening line of your first paragraph. Ask your reader to predict what your paper will be about. If he or she is unable to guess your topic accurately, you should consider revising your topic sentence so that it clearly defines your purpose in writing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Main Idea versus Controlling Idea</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">Topic sentences contain both a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">main idea</a><span class="glossdef">The topic discussed throughout the paragraph.</span></span> (the subject, or topic that the writer is discussing) and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controlling idea</a><span class="glossdef">Indicates the writer’s stance on the main idea of a paragraph. The controlling idea appears in the paragraph’s topic sentence.</span></span> (the writer’s specific stance on that subject). Just as a thesis statement includes an idea that controls a document’s focus (as you will read about in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>), a topic sentence must also contain a controlling idea to direct the paragraph. Different writers may use the same main idea but can steer their paragraph in a number of different directions according to their stance on the subject. Read the following examples.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01_n01">

(This topic sentence includes a main idea and a controlling thesis, but both are buried beneath the confusing sentence structure and unnecessary vocabulary. These obstacles make it difficult for the reader to follow.)</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Stronger example.</strong> Most forms of writing can be improved by first creating an outline.

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p22">When creating a workplace document, use the “top-down” approach—keep the topic sentence at the beginning of each paragraph so that readers immediately understand the gist of the message. This method saves busy colleagues precious time and effort trying to figure out the main points and relevant details.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p23">Headings are another helpful tool. In a text-heavy document, break up each paragraph with individual headings. These serve as useful navigation aids, enabling colleagues to skim through the document and locate paragraphs that are relevant to them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_p01">Learning how to develop a good topic sentence is the first step toward writing a solid paragraph. Once you have composed your topic sentence, you have a guideline for the rest of the paragraph. To complete the paragraph, a writer must support the topic sentence with additional information and summarize the main point with a concluding sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_p02">This section identifies the three major structural parts of a paragraph and covers how to develop a paragraph using transitional words and phrases.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p01">An effective paragraph contains three main parts: a topic sentence, the body, and the concluding sentence. A topic sentence is often the first sentence of a paragraph. This chapter has already discussed its purpose—to express a main idea combined with the writer’s attitude about the subject. The body of the paragraph usually follows, containing supporting details. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Supporting sentences</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence in the middle part of the paragraph that helps explain, enhance, or prove the topic sentence.</span></span> help explain, prove, or enhance the topic sentence. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concluding sentence</a><span class="glossdef">The final sentence of a paragraph that summarizes the topic sentence using different words.</span></span> is the last sentence in the paragraph. It reminds the reader of the main point by restating it in different words.</p>

            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_n01">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p03"><span class="token">After reading the new TV guide this week I had just one thought—why are we still being bombarded with reality shows?</span> This season, the plague of reality television continues to darken our airwaves. Along with the return of viewer favorites, we are to be cursed with yet another mindless creation. <em class="emphasis">Prisoner</em> follows the daily lives of eight suburban housewives who have chosen to be put in jail for the purposes of this fake psychological experiment. A preview for the first episode shows the usual tears and tantrums associated with reality television. I dread to think what producers will come up with next season, but if any of them are reading this blog—stop it! We’ve had enough reality television to last us a lifetime!</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p04">The first sentence of this paragraph is the topic sentence. It tells the reader that the paragraph will be about reality television shows, and it expresses the writer’s distaste for these shows through the use of the word <em class="emphasis">bombarded</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p05">Each of the following sentences in the paragraph supports the topic sentence by providing further information about a specific reality television show. The final sentence is the concluding sentence. It reiterates the main point that viewers are bored with reality television shows by using different words from the topic sentence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p06">Paragraphs that begin with the topic sentence move from the general to the specific. They open with a general statement about a subject (reality shows) and then discuss specific examples (the reality show <em class="emphasis">Prisoner</em>). Most academic essays contain the topic sentence at the beginning of the first paragraph.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p07">Now take a look at the following paragraph. The topic sentence is underlined for you.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_n02">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p08">Last year, a cat traveled 130 miles to reach its family, who had moved to another state and had left their pet behind. Even though it had never been to their new home, the cat was able to track down its former owners. A dog in my neighborhood can predict when its master is about to have a seizure. It makes sure that he does not hurt himself during an epileptic fit. <span class="token">Compared to many animals, our own senses are almost dull.</span></p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p09">The last sentence of this paragraph is the topic sentence. It draws on specific examples (a cat that tracked down its owners and a dog that can predict seizures) and then makes a general statement that draws a conclusion from these examples (animals’ senses are better than humans’). In this case, the supporting sentences are placed before the topic sentence and the concluding sentence is the same as the topic sentence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p10">This technique is frequently used in persuasive writing. The writer produces detailed examples as evidence to back up his or her point, preparing the reader to accept the concluding topic sentence as the truth.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p11">Sometimes, the topic sentence appears in the middle of a paragraph. Read the following example. The topic sentence is underlined for you.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_n03">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p12">For many years, I suffered from severe anxiety every time I took an exam. Hours before the exam, my heart would begin pounding, my legs would shake, and sometimes I would become physically unable to move. <span class="token">Last year, I was referred to a specialist and finally found a way to control my anxiety—breathing exercises.</span> It seems so simple, but by doing just a few breathing exercises a couple of hours before an exam, I gradually got my anxiety under control. The exercises help slow my heart rate and make me feel less anxious. Better yet, they require no pills, no equipment, and very little time. It’s amazing how just breathing correctly has helped me learn to manage my anxiety symptoms.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p13">In this paragraph, the underlined sentence is the topic sentence. It expresses the main idea—that breathing exercises can help control anxiety. The preceding sentences enable the writer to build up to his main point (breathing exercises can help control anxiety) by using a personal anecdote (how he used to suffer from anxiety). The supporting sentences then expand on how breathing exercises help the writer by providing additional information. The last sentence is the concluding sentence and restates how breathing can help manage anxiety.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p14">Placing a topic sentence in the middle of a paragraph is often used in creative writing. If you notice that you have used a topic sentence in the middle of a paragraph in an academic essay, read through the paragraph carefully to make sure that it contains only one major topic. To read more about topic sentences and where they appear in paragraphs, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Implied Topic Sentences</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">Some well-organized paragraphs do not contain a topic sentence at all. Instead of being directly stated, the main idea is implied in the content of the paragraph. Read the following example:</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_n01">
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p02">Heaving herself up the stairs, Luella had to pause for breath several times. She let out a wheeze as she sat down heavily in the wooden rocking chair. Tao approached her cautiously, as if she might crumble at the slightest touch. He studied her face, like parchment; stretched across the bones so finely he could almost see right through the skin to the decaying muscle underneath. Luella smiled a toothless grin.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p03">Although no single sentence in this paragraph states the main idea, the entire paragraph focuses on one concept—that Luella is extremely old. The topic sentence is thus implied rather than stated. This technique is often used in descriptive or narrative writing. Implied topic sentences work well if the writer has a firm idea of what he or she intends to say in the paragraph and sticks to it. However, a paragraph loses its effectiveness if an implied topic sentence is too subtle or the writer loses focus.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p04">Avoid using implied topic sentences in an informational document. Readers often lose patience if they are unable to quickly grasp what the writer is trying to say. The clearest and most efficient way to communicate in an informational document is to position the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph.</p>

Unlike other desert creatures, the kangaroo rat does not store water in its body but instead is able to convert the dry seeds it eats into moisture. Its ability to adapt to such a hostile environment makes the kangaroo rat a truly amazing creature.</p>

They make up the body of the paragraph by explaining, proving, or enhancing the controlling idea in the topic sentence. Most paragraphs contain three to six supporting sentences depending on the audience and purpose for writing. A supporting sentence usually offers one of the following:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p01">An effective concluding sentence draws together all the ideas you have raised in your paragraph. It reminds readers of the main point—the topic sentence—without restating it in exactly the same words. Using the hamburger example, the top bun (the topic sentence) and the bottom bun (the concluding sentence) are very similar. They frame the “meat” or body of the paragraph. Compare the topic sentence and concluding sentence from the previous example:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p04">Notice the use of the synonyms <em class="emphasis">advantages</em> and <em class="emphasis">benefits</em>. The concluding sentence reiterates the idea that owning a hybrid is advantageous without using the exact same words. It also summarizes two examples of the advantages covered in the supporting sentences: low running costs and environmental benefits.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p05">You should avoid introducing any new ideas into your concluding sentence.

To help organize a paragraph and ensure that ideas logically connect to one another, writers use transitional words and phrases. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transition</a><span class="glossdef">Words and phrases that show how the ideas in sentences and paragraphs are related.</span></span> is a connecting word that describes a relationship between ideas. Take another look at the earlier example:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s04_p03">Each of the underlined words is a transition word. Words such as <em class="emphasis">first</em> and <em class="emphasis">second</em> are transition words that show sequence or clarify order. They help organize the writer’s ideas by showing that he or she has another point to make in support of the topic sentence. Other transition words that show order include <em class="emphasis">third</em>, <em class="emphasis">also</em>, and <em class="emphasis">furthermore</em>.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s04_p04">The transition word <em class="emphasis">because</em> is a transition word of consequence that continues a line of thought. It indicates that the writer will provide an explanation of a result. In this sentence, the writer explains why hybrid cars will reduce dependency on fossil fuels (because they do not require gas). Other transition words of consequence include <em class="emphasis">as a result</em>, <em class="emphasis">so that</em>, <em class="emphasis">since</em>, or <em class="emphasis">for this reason</em>.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s04_p05">To include a summarizing transition in her concluding sentence, the writer could rewrite the final sentence as follows:</p>

They guide the reader through the document, clarifying relationships between sentences and paragraphs so that the reader understands why they have been written in that particular order.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s04_p11">For example, when writing an instructional memo, it may be helpful to consider the following transitional words and phrases: <em class="emphasis">before you begin</em>, <em class="emphasis">first</em>, <em class="emphasis">next</em>, <em class="emphasis">then</em>, <em class="emphasis">finally</em>, <em class="emphasis">after you have completed</em>. Using these transitions as a template to write your memo will provide readers with clear, logical instructions about a particular process and the order in which steps are supposed to be completed.</p>

                        <li>A good paragraph contains three distinct components: a topic sentence, body, and concluding sentence.</li>
                        <li>The topic sentence expresses the main idea of the paragraph combined with the writer’s attitude or opinion about the topic.</li>
                        <li>Good topic sentences contain both a main idea and a controlling idea, are clear and easy to follow, use engaging vocabulary, and provide an accurate indication of what will follow in the rest of the paragraph.</li>
                        <li>Topic sentences may be placed at the beginning, middle, or end of a paragraph. In most academic essays, the topic sentence is placed at the beginning of a paragraph.</li>
                        <li>Supporting sentences help explain, prove, or enhance the topic sentence by offering facts, reasons, statistics, quotations, or examples.</li>
                        <li>Concluding sentences summarize the key points in a paragraph and reiterate the main idea without repeating it word for word.</li>
                        <li>Transitional words and phrases help organize ideas in a paragraph and show how these ideas relate to one another.</li>
