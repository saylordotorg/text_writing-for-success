        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s01_p01">The purpose of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">classification</a><span class="glossdef">To break down a subject into smaller, more manageable, more specific parts.</span></span> is to break down broad subjects into smaller, more manageable, more specific parts. We classify things in our daily lives all the time, often without even thinking about it. Cell phones, for example, have now become part of a broad category. They can be classified as feature phones, media phones, and smartphones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s01_p02">Smaller categories, and the way in which these categories are created, help us make sense of the world. Keep both of these elements in mind when writing a classification essay.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s01_p03">Choose topics that you know well when writing classification essays. The more you know about a topic, the more you can break it into smaller, more interesting parts. Adding interest and insight will enhance your classification essays.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Structure of a Classification Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_p01">The classification essay opens with an introductory paragraph that introduces the broader topic. The thesis should then explain how that topic is divided into subgroups and why. Take the following introductory paragraph, for example:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_p02">When people think of New York, they often think of only New York City. But New York is actually a diverse state with a full range of activities to do, sights to see, and cultures to explore. <span class="token">In order to better understand the diversity of New York state, it is helpful to break it into these five separate regions: Long Island, New York City, Western New York, Central New York, and Northern New York.</span></p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_p03">The underlined thesis explains not only the category and subcategory but also the rationale for breaking it into those categories. Through this classification essay, the writer hopes to show his or her readers a different way of considering the state.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_p04">Each body paragraph of a classification essay is dedicated to fully illustrating each of the subcategories. In the previous example, then, each region of New York would have its own paragraph.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_p05">The conclusion should bring all the categories and subcategories back together again to show the reader the big picture. In the previous example, the conclusion might explain how the various sights and activities of each region of New York add to its diversity and complexity.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_p06">To avoid settling for an overly simplistic classification, make sure you break down any given topic at least three different ways. This will help you think outside the box and perhaps even learn something entirely new about a subject.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercise 2</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s02_p07">Using your classifications from <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s04_s01_n02">Note 10.43 "Exercise 1"</a>, write a brief paragraph explaining why you chose to organize each main category in the way that you did.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing a Classification Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s03_p01">Start with an engaging opening that will adequately introduce the general topic that you will be dividing into smaller subcategories. Your thesis should come at the end of your introduction. It should include the topic, your subtopics, and the reason you are choosing to break down the topic in the way that you are. Use the following classification thesis equation:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">topic + subtopics + rationale for the subtopics = thesis.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s03_p02">The organizing strategy of a classification essay is dictated by the initial topic and the subsequent subtopics. Each body paragraph is dedicated to fully illustrating each of the subtopics. In a way, coming up with a strong topic pays double rewards in a classification essay. Not only do you have a good topic, but you also have a solid organizational structure within which to write.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s03_p03">Be sure you use strong details and explanations for each subcategory paragraph that help explain and support your thesis. Also, be sure to give examples to illustrate your points. Finally, write a conclusion that links all the subgroups together again. The conclusion should successfully wrap up your essay by connecting it to your topic initially discussed in the introduction. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch15#fresh-ch15">Chapter 15 "Readings: Examples of Essays"</a> to read a sample classification essay.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercise 3</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s04_s03_p04">Building on <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s04_s01_n02">Note 10.43 "Exercise 1"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s04_s02_n03">Note 10.46 "Exercise 2"</a>, write a five-paragraph classification essay about one of the four original topics. In your thesis, make sure to include the topic, subtopics, and rationale for your breakdown. And make sure that your essay is organized into paragraphs that each describes a subtopic.</p>
