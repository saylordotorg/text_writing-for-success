        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s01_p01">The purpose of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">process analysis essay</a><span class="glossdef">An essay that explains how to do something, how something works, or both.</span></span> is to explain how to do something or how something works. In either case, the formula for a process analysis essay remains the same. The process is articulated into clear, definitive steps.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s01_p02">Almost everything we do involves following a step-by-step process. From riding a bike as children to learning various jobs as adults, we initially needed instructions to effectively execute the task. Likewise, we have likely had to instruct others, so we know how important good directions areâ€”and how frustrating it is when they are poorly put together.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s01_p03">The next time you have to explain a process to someone at work, be mindful of how clearly you articulate each step. Strong communication skills are critical for workplace satisfaction and advancement. Effective process analysis plays a critical role in developing that skill set.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Structure of a Process Analysis Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s02_p01">The process analysis essay opens with a discussion of the process and a thesis statement that states the goal of the process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s02_p02">The organization of a process analysis essay typically follows chronological order. The steps of the process are conveyed in the order in which they usually occur. Body paragraphs will be constructed based on these steps. If a particular step is complicated and needs a lot of explaining, then it will likely take up a paragraph on its own. But if a series of simple steps is easier to understand, then the steps can be grouped into a single paragraph.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s02_p03">The time transition phrases covered in the Narration and Illustration sections are also helpful in organizing process analysis essays (see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch10_s01#fresh-ch10_s01_s02_t01">Table 10.1 "Transition Words and Phrases for Expressing Time"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch10_s02#fresh-ch10_s02_s02_t01">Table 10.2 "Phrases of Illustration"</a>). Words such as <em class="emphasis">first</em>, <em class="emphasis">second</em>, <em class="emphasis">third</em>, <em class="emphasis">next</em>, and <em class="emphasis">finally</em> are helpful cues to orient reader and organize the content of essay.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s02_p04">Always have someone else read your process analysis to make sure it makes sense. Once we get too close to a subject, it is difficult to determine how clearly an idea is coming across. Having a friend or coworker read it over will serve as a good way to troubleshoot any confusing spots.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercise 2</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s02_p05">Choose two of the lists you created in <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s05_s01_n02">Note 10.52 "Exercise 1"</a> and start writing out the processes in paragraph form. Try to construct paragraphs based on the complexity of each step. For complicated steps, dedicate an entire paragraph. If less complicated steps fall in succession, group them into a single paragraph.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing a Process Analysis Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s03_p01">Choose a topic that is interesting, is relatively complex, and can be explained in a series of steps. As with other rhetorical writing modes, choose a process that you know well so that you can more easily describe the finer details about each step in the process. Your thesis statement should come at the end of your introduction, and it should state the final outcome of the process you are describing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s05_s03_p02">Body paragraphs are composed of the steps in the process. Each step should be expressed using strong details and clear examples. Use time transition phrases to help organize steps in the process and to orient readers. The conclusion should thoroughly describe the result of the process described in the body paragraphs. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch15#fresh-ch15">Chapter 15 "Readings: Examples of Essays"</a> to read an example of a process analysis essay.</p>
