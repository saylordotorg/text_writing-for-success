    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_p01">Why was the Great Wall of China built? What have scientists learned about the possibility of life on Mars? What roles did women play in the American Revolution? How does the human brain create, store, and retrieve memories? Who invented the game of football, and how has it changed over the years?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_p02">You may know the answers to these questions off the top of your head. If you are like most people, however, you find answers to tough questions like these by searching the Internet, visiting the library, or asking others for information. To put it simply, you perform research.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_p03">Whether you are a scientist, an artist, a paralegal, or a parent, you probably perform research in your everyday life. When your boss, your instructor, or a family member asks you a question that you do not know the answer to, you locate relevant information, analyze your findings, and share your results. Locating, analyzing, and sharing information are key steps in the research process, and in this chapter, you will learn more about each step. By developing your research writing skills, you will prepare yourself to answer any question no matter how challenging.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reasons for Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_p01">When you perform research, you are essentially trying to solve a mystery—you want to know how something works or why something happened. In other words, you want to answer a question that you (and other people) have about the world. This is one of the most basic reasons for performing research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_p02">But the research process does not end when you have solved your mystery. Imagine what would happen if a detective collected enough evidence to solve a criminal case, but she never shared her solution with the authorities. Presenting what you have learned from research can be just as important as performing the research. Research results can be presented in a variety of ways, but one of the most popular—and effective—presentation forms is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research paper</a><span class="glossdef">A composition that presents an original thesis about a topic and develops that thesis with information gathered from a variety of sources.</span></span>. A research paper presents an original thesis, or purpose statement, about a topic and develops that thesis with information gathered from a variety of sources.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_p03">If you are curious about the possibility of life on Mars, for example, you might choose to research the topic. What will you do, though, when your research is complete? You will need a way to put your thoughts together in a logical, coherent manner. You may want to use the facts you have learned to create a narrative or to support an argument. And you may want to show the results of your research to your friends, your teachers, or even the editors of magazines and journals. Writing a research paper is an ideal way to organize thoughts, craft narratives or make arguments based on research, and share your newfound knowledge with the world.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercise 1</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_p04">Write a paragraph about a time when you used research in your everyday life. Did you look for the cheapest way to travel from Houston to Denver? Did you search for a way to remove gum from the bottom of your shoe? In your paragraph, explain what you wanted to research, how you performed the research, and what you learned as a result.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Research Writing and the Academic Paper</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p01">No matter what field of study you are interested in, you will most likely be asked to write a research paper during your academic career. For example, a student in an art history course might write a research paper about an artist’s work. Similarly, a student in a psychology course might write a research paper about current findings in childhood development.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p02">Having to write a research paper may feel intimidating at first. After all, researching and writing a long paper requires a lot of time, effort, and organization. However, writing a research paper can also be a great opportunity to explore a topic that is particularly interesting to you. The research process allows you to gain expertise on a topic of your choice, and the writing process helps you remember what you have learned and understand it on a deeper level.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_s02_p01">Knowing how to write a good research paper is a valuable skill that will serve you well throughout your career. Whether you are developing a new product, studying the best way to perform a procedure, or learning about challenges and opportunities in your field of employment, you will use research techniques to guide your exploration. You may even need to create a written report of your findings. And because effective communication is essential to any company, employers seek to hire people who can write clearly and professionally.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_p01">How does a research paper grow from a folder of brainstormed notes to a polished final draft? No two projects are identical, but most projects follow a series of six basic steps.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_p02">These are the steps in the research writing process:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Choose a topic.</li>

        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_p03">Each of these steps will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. For now, though, we will take a brief look at what each step involves.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Choosing a Topic</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p01">As you may recall from <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>, to narrow the focus of your topic, you may try freewriting exercises, such as brainstorming. You may also need to ask a specific <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research question</a><span class="glossdef">A broad, open-ended question that a writer uses to guide the research process. In the research paper, the writer attempts to answer the question thoughtfully.</span></span>—a broad, open-ended question that will guide your research—as well as propose a possible answer, or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">working thesis</a><span class="glossdef">The first thesis statement a writer uses while outlining an assignment. A working thesis statement may change during the writing process.</span></span>. You may use your research question and your working thesis to create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research proposal</a><span class="glossdef">A brief document that includes a writer’s main research question, related subquestions, working thesis, and plan for gathering information.</span></span>. In a research proposal, you present your main research question, any related subquestions you plan to explore, and your working thesis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Planning and Scheduling</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p01">Before you start researching your topic, take time to plan your researching and writing schedule. Research projects can take days, weeks, or even months to complete. Creating a schedule is a good way to ensure that you do not end up being overwhelmed by all the work you have to do as the deadline approaches.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p02">During this step of the process, it is also a good idea to plan the resources and organizational tools you will use to keep yourself on track throughout the project. Flowcharts, calendars, and checklists can all help you stick to your schedule. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11_s02#fresh-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Steps in Developing a Research Proposal"</a> for an example of a research schedule.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Conducting Research</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s03_p01">When going about your research, you will likely use a variety of sources—anything from books and periodicals to video presentations and in-person interviews.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s03_p02">Your sources will include both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary sources</a><span class="glossdef">Research sources that provide raw information or data without commentary or interpretation, such as surveys, interviews, and historical documents.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary sources</a><span class="glossdef">Research sources that provide information and include some analysis or interpretation of the information. Scholarly journals and magazine articles are usually considered secondary sources.</span></span>. Primary sources provide firsthand information or raw data. For example, surveys, in-person interviews, and historical documents are primary sources. Secondary sources, such as biographies, literary reviews, or magazine articles, include some analysis or interpretation of the information presented. As you conduct research, you will take detailed, careful notes about your discoveries. You will also evaluate the reliability of each source you find.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 4: Organizing Research and the Writer’s Ideas</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04_p01">When your research is complete, you will organize your findings and decide which sources to cite in your paper. You will also have an opportunity to evaluate the evidence you have collected and determine whether it supports your thesis, or the focus of your paper. You may decide to adjust your thesis or conduct additional research to ensure that your thesis is well supported.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04_p02">Remember, your working thesis is not set in stone. You can and should change your working thesis throughout the research writing process if the evidence you find does not support your original thesis. Never try to force evidence to fit your argument. For example, your working thesis is “Mars cannot support life-forms.” Yet, a week into researching your topic, you find an article in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> detailing new findings of bacteria under the Martian surface. Instead of trying to argue that bacteria are not life forms, you might instead alter your thesis to “Mars cannot support complex life-forms.”</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 5: Drafting Your Paper</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s05_p01">Now you are ready to combine your research findings with your critical analysis of the results in a rough draft. You will incorporate source materials into your paper and discuss each source thoughtfully in relation to your thesis or purpose statement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s05_p02">When you cite your reference sources, it is important to pay close attention to standard conventions for citing sources in order to avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">plagiarism</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of using someone else’s words or ideas without acknowledging the source.</span></span>, or the practice of using someone else’s words without acknowledging the source. Later in this chapter, you will learn how to incorporate sources in your paper and avoid some of the most common pitfalls of attributing information.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 6: Revising and Editing Your Paper</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s06_p01">In the final step of the research writing process, you will revise and polish your paper. You might reorganize your paper’s structure or revise for unity and cohesion, ensuring that each element in your paper flows into the next logically and naturally. You will also make sure that your paper uses an appropriate and consistent tone.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s06_p02">Once you feel confident in the strength of your writing, you will edit your paper for proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, mechanics, and formatting. When you complete this final step, you will have transformed a simple idea or question into a thoroughly researched and well-written paper you can be proud of!</p>
