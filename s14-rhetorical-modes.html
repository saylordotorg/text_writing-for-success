This chapter covers nine common rhetorical modes. As you read about these nine modes, keep in mind that the rhetorical mode a writer chooses depends on his or her purpose for writing.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Narrative Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p01">Narration means the art of storytelling, and the purpose of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">narrative writing</a><span class="glossdef">The art of telling stories.</span></span> is to tell stories. Any time you tell a story to a friend or family member about an event or incident in your day, you engage in a form of narration. In addition, a narrative can be factual or fictional. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">factual story</a><span class="glossdef">A story based on—and faithful to—actual events as they happened in real life.</span></span> is one that is based on, and tries to be faithful to, actual events as they unfolded in real life. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fictional story</a><span class="glossdef">A made-up, or imagined, story.</span></span> is a made-up, or imagined, story; the writer of a fictional story can create characters and events as he or she sees fit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p02">The big distinction between factual and fictional narratives is based on a writer’s purpose. The writers of factual stories try to recount events as they actually happened, but writers of fictional stories can depart from real people and events because the writers’ intents are not to retell a real-life event. Biographies and memoirs are examples of factual stories, whereas novels and short stories are examples of fictional stories.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p03">Because the line between fact and fiction can often blur, it is helpful to understand what your purpose is from the beginning. Is it important that you recount history, either your own or someone else’s? Or does your interest lie in reshaping the world in your own image—either how you would like to see it or how you imagine it could be? Your answers will go a long way in shaping the stories you tell.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s01_p04">Ultimately, whether the story is fact or fiction, narrative writing tries to relay a series of events in an emotionally engaging way. You want your audience to be moved by your story, which could mean through laughter, sympathy, fear, anger, and so on. The more clearly you tell your story, the more emotionally engaged your audience is likely to be.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p01">When writing a narrative essay, start by asking yourself if you want to write a factual or fictional story. Then freewrite about topics that are of general interest to you. For more information about freewriting, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p02">Once you have a general idea of what you will be writing about, you should sketch out the major events of the story that will compose your plot. Typically, these events will be revealed chronologically and climax at a central conflict that must be resolved by the end of the story. The use of strong details is crucial as you describe the events and characters in your narrative. You want the reader to emotionally engage with the world that you create in writing.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p03">To create strong details, keep the human senses in mind. You want your reader to be immersed in the world that you create, so focus on details related to sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch as you describe people, places, and events in your narrative.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s01_s03_p04">As always, it is important to start with a strong introduction to hook your reader into wanting to read more. Try opening the essay with an event that is interesting to introduce the story and get it going. Finally, your conclusion should help resolve the central conflict of the story and impress upon your reader the ultimate theme of the piece. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch15#fresh-ch15">Chapter 15 "Readings: Examples of Essays"</a> to read a sample narrative essay.</p>

An effective <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">illustration essay</a><span class="glossdef">An essay that clearly demonstrates and supports a point through the use of evidence.</span></span> clearly demonstrates and supports a point through the use of evidence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p02">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>, the controlling idea of an essay is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay. A thesis statement is often one sentence long, and it states the writer’s point of view.</span></span>. A writer can use different types of evidence to support his or her thesis. Using scientific studies, experts in a particular field, statistics, historical events, current events, analogies, and personal anecdotes are all ways in which a writer can illustrate a thesis. Ultimately, you want the evidence to help the reader “see” your point, as one would see a good illustration in a magazine or on a website. The stronger your evidence is, the more clearly the reader will consider your point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p03">Using evidence effectively can be challenging, though. The evidence you choose will usually depend on your subject and who your reader is (your audience). When writing an illustration essay, keep in mind the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Use evidence that is appropriate to your topic as well as appropriate for your audience.</li>
            <li>Assess how much evidence you need to adequately explain your point depending on the complexity of the subject and the knowledge of your audience regarding that subject.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p04">For example, if you were writing about a new communication software and your audience was a group of English-major undergrads, you might want to use an analogy or a personal story to illustrate how the software worked. You might also choose to add a few more pieces of evidence to make sure the audience understands your point. However, if you were writing about the same subject and you audience members were information technology (IT) specialists, you would likely use more technical evidence because they would be familiar with the subject.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p05">Keeping in mind your subject in relation to your audience will increase your chances of effectively illustrating your point.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s02_s01_p06">You never want to insult your readers’ intelligence by overexplaining concepts the audience members may already be familiar with, but it may be necessary to clearly articulate your point. When in doubt, add an extra example to illustrate your idea.</p>

The steps of the process are conveyed in the order in which they usually occur. Body paragraphs will be constructed based on these steps. If a particular step is complicated and needs a lot of explaining, then it will likely take up a paragraph on its own.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Definition in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p01">The purpose of a definition essay may seem self-explanatory: the purpose of the definition essay is to simply define something. But defining terms in writing is often more complicated than just consulting a dictionary. In fact, the way we define terms can have far-reaching consequences for individuals as well as collective groups.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p02">Take, for example, a word like <em class="emphasis">alcoholism</em>. The way in which one defines alcoholism depends on its legal, moral, and medical contexts. Lawyers may define alcoholism in terms of its legality; parents may define alcoholism in terms of its morality; and doctors will define alcoholism in terms of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Think also of terms that people tend to debate in our broader culture. How we define words, such as <em class="emphasis">marriage</em> and <em class="emphasis">climate change</em>, has enormous impact on policy decisions and even on daily decisions. Think about conversations couples may have in which words like <em class="emphasis">commitment</em>, <em class="emphasis">respect</em>, or <em class="emphasis">love</em> need clarification.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p03">Defining terms within a relationship, or any other context, can at first be difficult, but once a definition is established between two people or a group of people, it is easier to have productive dialogues. Definitions, then, establish the way in which people communicate ideas. They set parameters for a given discourse, which is why they are so important.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p04">When writing definition essays, avoid terms that are too simple, that lack complexity. Think in terms of concepts, such as <em class="emphasis">hero</em>, <em class="emphasis">immigration</em>, or <em class="emphasis">loyalty</em>, rather than physical objects. Definitions of concepts, rather than objects, are often fluid and contentious, making for a more effective definition essay.</p>

Sexual harassment is broadly defined on the federal level, but each company may have additional criteria that define it further. Knowing how your workplace defines and treats all sexual harassment allegations is important. Think, too, about how your company defines <em class="emphasis">lateness</em>, <em class="emphasis">productivity</em>, or <em class="emphasis">contributions</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p01">The definition essay opens with a general discussion of the term to be defined. You then state as your thesis your definition of the term.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p02">The rest of the essay should explain the rationale for your definition. Remember that a dictionary’s definition is limiting, and you should not rely strictly on the dictionary entry. Instead, consider the context in which you are using the word. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Context</a><span class="glossdef">The circumstances, conditions, or setting in which something exists or occurs.</span></span> identifies the circumstances, conditions, or setting in which something exists or occurs. Often words take on different meanings depending on the context in which they are used. For example, the ideal leader in a battlefield setting could likely be very different than a leader in an elementary school setting. If a context is missing from the essay, the essay may be too short or the main points could be confusing or misunderstood.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p03">The remainder of the essay should explain different aspects of the term’s definition. For example, if you were defining a good leader in an elementary classroom setting, you might define such a leader according to personality traits: patience, consistency, and flexibility. Each attribute would be explained in its own paragraph.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p04">For definition essays, try to think of concepts that you have a personal stake in. You are more likely to write a more engaging definition essay if you are writing about an idea that has personal value and importance.</p>

Identify your role at work by defining not only the routine tasks but also those gray areas where your responsibilities might overlap with those of others. Coming up with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities can add value to your résumé and even increase productivity in the workplace.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s07_s01_p02">The key to a good compare-and-contrast essay is to choose two or more subjects that connect in a meaningful way. The purpose of conducting the comparison or contrast is not to state the obvious but rather to illuminate subtle differences or unexpected similarities. For example, if you wanted to focus on contrasting two subjects you would not pick apples and oranges; rather, you might choose to compare and contrast two types of oranges or two types of apples to highlight subtle differences. For example, Red Delicious apples are sweet, while Granny Smiths are tart and acidic. Drawing distinctions between elements in a similar category will increase the audience’s understanding of that category, which is the purpose of the compare-and-contrast essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s07_s01_p03">Similarly, to focus on comparison, choose two subjects that seem at first to be unrelated. For a comparison essay, you likely would not choose two apples or two oranges because they share so many of the same properties already. Rather, you might try to compare how apples and oranges are quite similar. The more divergent the two subjects initially seem, the more interesting a comparison essay will be.</p>

The thesis could lean more toward comparing, contrasting, or both. Remember, the point of comparing and contrasting is to provide useful knowledge to the reader. Take the following thesis as an example that leans more toward contrasting.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s07_s02_p03">Here the thesis sets up the two subjects to be compared and contrasted (organic versus conventional vegetables), and it makes a claim about the results that might prove useful to the reader.</p>

Once you have decided on a topic, introduce it with an engaging opening paragraph. Your thesis should come at the end of the introduction, and it should establish the subjects you will compare, contrast, or both as well as state what can be learned from doing so.</p>

The organizing strategy that you choose will depend on, as always, your audience and your purpose. You may also consider your particular approach to the subjects as well as the nature of the subjects themselves; some subjects might better lend themselves to one structure or the other. Make sure to use comparison and contrast phrases to cue the reader to the ways in which you are analyzing the relationship between the subjects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s07_s03_p03">After you finish analyzing the subjects, write a conclusion that summarizes the main points of the essay and reinforces your thesis.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s01_p01">It is often considered human nature to ask, “why?” and “how?” We want to know how our child got sick so we can better prevent it from happening in the future, or why our colleague a pay raise because we want one as well. We want to know how much money we will save over the long term if we buy a hybrid car. These examples identify only a few of the relationships we think about in our lives, but each shows the importance of understanding cause and effect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s01_p02">A cause is something that produces an event or condition; an effect is what results from an event or condition. The purpose of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cause-and-effect essay</a><span class="glossdef">An essay that tries to determine how various phenomena are related.</span></span> is to determine how various phenomena relate in terms of origins and results. Sometimes the connection between cause and effect is clear, but often determining the exact relationship between the two is very difficult. For example, the following effects of a cold may be easily identifiable: a sore throat, runny nose, and a cough. But determining the cause of the sickness can be far more difficult. A number of causes are possible, and to complicate matters, these possible causes could have combined to cause the sickness. That is, more than one cause may be responsible for any given effect. Therefore, cause-and-effect discussions are often complicated and frequently lead to debates and arguments.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s08_s01_p03">Use the complex nature of cause and effect to your advantage. Often it is not necessary, or even possible, to find the exact cause of an event or to name the exact effect. So, when formulating a thesis, you can claim one of a number of causes or effects to be the primary, or main, cause or effect. As soon as you claim that one cause or one effect is more crucial than the others, you have developed a thesis.</p>

The act of trying to persuade automatically implies more than one opinion on the subject can be argued.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s01_p02">The idea of an argument often conjures up images of two people yelling and screaming in anger. In writing, however, an argument is very different. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">argument</a><span class="glossdef">A reasoned opinion supported and explained by evidence.</span></span> is a reasoned opinion supported and explained by evidence. To argue in writing is to advance knowledge and ideas in a positive way. Written arguments often fail when they employ ranting rather than reasoning.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s01_p03">Most of us feel inclined to try to win the arguments we engage in. On some level, we all want to be right, and we want others to see the error of their ways. More times than not, however, arguments in which both sides try to win end up producing losers all around. The more productive approach is to persuade your audience to consider your opinion as a valid one, not simply the right one.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s01_p01">The persuasive essay begins with an engaging introduction that presents the general topic. The thesis typically appears somewhere in the introduction and states the writer’s point of view.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s01_p02">Avoid forming a thesis based on a negative claim. For example, “The hourly minimum wage is not high enough for the average worker to live on.” This is probably a true statement, but persuasive arguments should make a positive case. That is, the thesis statement should focus on how the hourly minimum wage is low or insufficient.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Acknowledging Opposing Ideas and Limits to Your Argument</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p01">Because an argument implies differing points of view on the subject, you must be sure to acknowledge those opposing ideas. Avoiding ideas that conflict with your own gives the reader the impression that you may be uncertain, fearful, or unaware of opposing ideas. Thus it is essential that you not only address counterarguments but also do so respectfully.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p02">Try to address opposing arguments earlier rather than later in your essay. Rhetorically speaking, ordering your positive arguments last allows you to better address ideas that conflict with your own, so you can spend the rest of the essay countering those arguments. This way, you leave your reader thinking about your argument rather than someone else’s. You have the last word.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p03">Acknowledging points of view different from your own also has the effect of fostering more credibility between you and the audience. They know from the outset that you are aware of opposing ideas and that you are not afraid to give them space.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p04">It is also helpful to establish the limits of your argument and what you are trying to accomplish. In effect, you are conceding early on that your argument is not the ultimate authority on a given topic. Such humility can go a long way toward earning credibility and trust with an audience. Audience members will know from the beginning that you are a reasonable writer, and audience members will trust your argument as a result. For example, in the following concessionary statement, the writer advocates for stricter gun control laws, but she admits it will not solve all of our problems with crime:</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_n01">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p05">Although tougher gun control laws are a powerful first step in decreasing violence in our streets, such legislation alone cannot end these problems since guns are not the only problem we face.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p06">Such a concession will be welcome by those who might disagree with this writer’s argument in the first place. To effectively persuade their readers, writers need to be modest in their goals and humble in their approach to get readers to listen to the ideas. See <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_t01">Table 10.5 "Phrases of Concession"</a> for some useful phrases of concession.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Bias in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p01">Everyone has various biases on any number of topics. For example, you might have a bias toward wearing black instead of brightly colored clothes or wearing jeans rather than formal wear. You might have a bias toward working at night rather than in the morning, or working by deadlines rather than getting tasks done in advance. These examples identify minor biases, of course, but they still indicate preferences and opinions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p02">Handling bias in writing and in daily life can be a useful skill. It will allow you to articulate your own points of view while also defending yourself against unreasonable points of view. The ideal in persuasive writing is to let your reader know your bias, but do not let that bias blind you to the primary components of good argumentation: sound, thoughtful evidence and a respectful and reasonable address of opposing sides.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p03">The strength of a personal bias is that it can motivate you to construct a strong argument. If you are invested in the topic, you are more likely to care about the piece of writing. Similarly, the more you care, the more time and effort you are apt to put forth and the better the final product will be.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p04">The weakness of bias is when the bias begins to take over the essay—when, for example, you neglect opposing ideas, exaggerate your points, or repeatedly insert yourself ahead of the subject by using <em class="emphasis">I</em> too often. Being aware of all three of these pitfalls will help you avoid them.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Use of <em class="emphasis bolditalic">I</em> in Writing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_p01">The use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> in writing is often a topic of debate, and the acceptance of its usage varies from instructor to instructor. It is difficult to predict the preferences for all your present and future instructors, but consider the effects it can potentially have on your writing.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_p02">Be mindful of the use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> in your writing because it can make your argument sound overly biased. There are two primary reasons:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>Excessive repetition of any word will eventually catch the reader’s attention—and usually not in a good way. The use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> is no different.</li>
                <li>The insertion of <em class="emphasis">I</em> into a sentence alters not only the way a sentence might sound but also the composition of the sentence itself. <em class="emphasis">I</em> is often the subject of a sentence. If the subject of the essay is supposed to be, say, smoking, then by inserting yourself into the sentence, you are effectively displacing the subject of the essay into a secondary position. In the following example, the subject of the sentence is underlined:</li>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_p05">In the first sentence, the rightful subject, <em class="emphasis">smoking</em>, is in the subject position in the sentence. In the second sentence, the insertion of <em class="emphasis">I</em> and <em class="emphasis">think</em> replaces <em class="emphasis">smoking</em> as the subject, which draws attention to <em class="emphasis">I</em> and away from the topic that is supposed to be discussed. Remember to keep the message (the subject) and the messenger (the writer) separate.</p>

The purpose of using quantitative visuals is to make logical appeals to the audience. For example, sometimes it is easier to understand the disparity in certain statistics if you can see how the disparity looks graphically.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p01">Choose a topic that you feel passionate about. If your instructor requires you to write about a specific topic, approach the subject from an angle that interests you. Begin your essay with an engaging introduction. Your thesis should typically appear somewhere in your introduction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p02">Start by acknowledging and explaining points of view that may conflict with your own to build credibility and trust with your audience. Also state the limits of your argument. This too helps you sound more reasonable and honest to those who may naturally be inclined to disagree with your view. By respectfully acknowledging opposing arguments and conceding limitations to your own view, you set a measured and responsible tone for the essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p03">Make your appeals in support of your thesis by using sound, credible evidence. Use a balance of facts and opinions from a wide range of sources, such as scientific studies, expert testimony, statistics, and personal anecdotes. Each piece of evidence should be fully explained and clearly stated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p04">Make sure that your style and tone are appropriate for your subject and audience. Tailor your language and word choice to these two factors, while still being true to your own voice.</p>

                <li>Make sure that your word choice and writing style is appropriate for both your subject and your audience.</li>
                <li>You should let your reader know your bias, but do not let that bias blind you to the primary components of good argumentation: sound, thoughtful evidence and respectfully and reasonably addressing opposing ideas.</li>
                <li>You should be mindful of the use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> in your writing because it can make your argument sound more biased than it needs to.</li>
                <li>Facts are statements that can be proven using objective data.</li>
                <li>Opinions are personal views, or judgments, that cannot be proven.</li>
                <li>In writing, you want to strike a balance between credible facts and authoritative opinions.</li>
                <li>Quantitative visuals present data graphically. The purpose of using quantitative visuals is to make logical appeals to the audience.</li>
                <li>Qualitative visuals present images that appeal to the audience’s emotions.</li>

            <li>The thesis statement is a fundamental element of writing regardless of what rhetorical mode you are writing in. Formulate one more thesis for each of the modes discussed in this chapter.</li>
            <li>Which rhetorical mode seems most aligned with who you are as a person? That is, which mode seems most useful to you? Explain why in a paragraph.</li>
            <li>Over the next week, look closely at the texts and articles you read. Document in a journal exactly what type of rhetorical mode is being used. Sometimes it might be for an entire article, but sometimes you might see different modes within one article. The more you can detect various ways of communicating ideas, the easier it will be to do yourself.</li>
