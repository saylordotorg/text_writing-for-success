    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_p02">The body paragraphs present the evidence you have gathered to confirm your thesis.

It is the most important information you select to argue for your point of view. Each point you choose will be incorporated into the topic sentence for each body paragraph you write. Your primary supporting points are further supported by supporting details within the paragraphs.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_p02">Remember that a worthy argument is backed by examples. In order to construct a valid argument, good writers conduct lots of background research and take careful notes. They also talk to people knowledgeable about a topic in order to understand its implications before writing about it.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Identify the Characteristics of Good Primary Support</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">In order to fulfill the requirements of good primary support, the information you choose must meet the following standards:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be specific.</strong> The main points you make about your thesis and the examples you use to expand on those points need to be specific. Use specific examples to provide the evidence and to build upon your general ideas. These types of examples give your reader something narrow to focus on, and if used properly, they leave little doubt about your claim. General examples, while they convey the necessary information, are not nearly as compelling or useful in writing because they are too obvious and typical.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be relevant to the thesis.</strong> Primary support is considered strong when it relates directly to the thesis. Primary support should show, explain, or prove your main argument without delving into irrelevant details. When faced with lots of information that could be used to prove your thesis, you may think you need to include it all in your body paragraphs. But effective writers resist the temptation to lose focus. Choose your examples wisely by making sure they directly connect to your thesis.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be detailed.</strong> Remember that your thesis, while specific, should not be very detailed. The body paragraphs are where you develop the discussion that a thorough essay requires. Using detailed support shows readers that you have considered all the facts and chosen only the most precise details to enhance your point of view.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Prewrite to Identify Primary Supporting Points for a Thesis Statement</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p01">Recall that when you prewrite you essentially make a list of examples or reasons why you support your stance. Stemming from each point, you further provide details to support those reasons. After prewriting, you are then able to look back at the information and choose the most compelling pieces you will use in your body paragraphs.</p>
            <div class="exercises editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s02_n01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p01">After you have prewritten about your working thesis statement, you may have generated a lot of information, which may be edited out later. Remember that your primary support must be relevant to your thesis. Remind yourself of your main argument, and delete any ideas that do not directly relate to it. Omitting unrelated ideas ensures that you will use only the most convincing information in your body paragraphs. Choose at least three of only the most compelling points. These will serve as the topic sentences for your body paragraphs.</p>

Remember that the points you choose must be specific and relevant to the thesis. The statements you choose will be your primary support points, and you will later incorporate them into the topic sentences for the body paragraphs.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s03_p04">When you support your thesis, you are revealing evidence. Evidence includes anything that can help support your stance. The following are the kinds of evidence you will encounter as you conduct your research:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Facts.</strong> Facts are the best kind of evidence to use because they often cannot be disputed. They can support your stance by providing background information on or a solid foundation for your point of view. However, some facts may still need explanation. For example, the sentence “The most populated state in the United States is California” is a pure fact, but it may require some explanation to make it relevant to your specific argument.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Judgments.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Judgments</a><span class="glossdef">A conclusion that is inferred from the facts of a matter.</span></span> are conclusions drawn from the given facts. Judgments are more credible than opinions because they are founded upon careful reasoning and examination of a topic.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Testimony.</strong> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Testimony</a><span class="glossdef">Quotations from people involved in a matter. It lends authenticity and credibility to an argument.</span></span> consists of direct quotations from either an eyewitness or an expert witness. An eyewitness is someone who has direct experience with a subject; he adds authenticity to an argument based on facts. An expert witness is a person who has extensive experience with a topic. This person studies the facts and provides commentary based on either facts or judgments, or both. An expert witness adds authority and credibility to an argument.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Personal observation.</strong> Personal observation is similar to testimony, but personal observation consists of your testimony. It reflects what you know to be true because you have experiences and have formed either opinions or judgments about them. For instance, if you are one of five children and your thesis states that being part of a large family is beneficial to a child’s social development, you could use your own experience to support your thesis.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Choose Supporting Topic Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s02_p01">Each body paragraph contains a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">The sentence in a paragraph that controls the point of the paragraph.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s02_p02">Each body paragraph should comprise the following elements.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s02_s02_p04">As you read in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>, topic sentences indicate the location and main points of the basic arguments of your essay. These sentences are vital to writing your body paragraphs because they always refer back to and support your thesis statement. Topic sentences are linked to the ideas you have introduced in your thesis, thus reminding readers what your essay is about. A paragraph without a clearly identified topic sentence may be unclear and scattered, just like an essay without a thesis statement.</p>

You can state it at the beginning of the body paragraph, or at the end of the paragraph, or you do not have to write it at all. This is called an implied topic sentence. An implied topic sentence lets readers form the main idea for themselves. For beginning writers, it is best to not use implied topic sentences because it makes it harder to focus your writing. Your instructor may also want to clearly identify the sentences that support your thesis. For more information on the placement of thesis statements and implied topic statements, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.</p>
