        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch09_s04_l01">
            <li>Recognize the importance of strong introductory and concluding paragraphs.</li>
            <li>Learn to engage the reader immediately with the introductory paragraph.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_p01">Picture your introduction as a storefront window: You have a certain amount of space to attract your customers (readers) to your goods (subject) and bring them inside your store (discussion). Once you have enticed them with something intriguing, you then point them in a specific direction and try to make the sale (convince them to accept your thesis).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_p02">Your introduction is an invitation to your readers to consider what you have to say and then to follow your train of thought as you expand upon your thesis statement.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_n02">
        <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_p03">An introduction serves the following purposes:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch09_s04_l02">
            <li>Establishes your voice and tone, or your attitude, toward the subject</li>
            <li>Introduces the general topic of the essay</li>
            <li>States the thesis that will be supported in the body paragraphs</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_p04">First impressions are crucial and can leave lasting effects in your reader’s mind, which is why the introduction is so important to your essay. If your introductory paragraph is dull or disjointed, your reader probably will not have much interest in continuing with the essay.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Attracting Interest in Your Introductory Paragraph</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Your introduction should begin with an engaging statement devised to provoke your readers’ interest. In the next few sentences, introduce them to your topic by stating general facts or ideas about the subject. As you move deeper into your introduction, you gradually narrow the focus, moving closer to your thesis. Moving smoothly and logically from your introductory remarks to your thesis statement can be achieved using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">funnel technique</a><span class="glossdef">A writing device that begins with a broad statement and then gradually moves toward the heart of the matter.</span></span>, as illustrated in the diagram in <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch09_s04_s01_f01">Figure 9.1 "Funnel Technique"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_p03">Immediately capturing your readers’ interest increases the chances of having them read what you are about to discuss. You can garner curiosity for your essay in a number of ways. Try to get your readers personally involved by doing any of the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Appealing to their emotions</li>
            <li>Using logic</li>
            <li>Beginning with a provocative question or opinion</li>
            <li>Opening with a startling statistic or surprising fact</li>
            <li>Raising a question or series of questions</li>
            <li>Presenting an explanation or rationalization for your essay</li>
            <li>Opening with a relevant quotation or incident</li>
            <li>Opening with a striking image</li>
            <li>Including a personal anecdote</li>

        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_p04">Remember that your diction, or word choice, while always important, is most crucial in your introductory paragraph. Boring diction could extinguish any desire a person might have to read through your discussion. Choose words that create images or express action. For more information on diction, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch04#fresh-ch04">Chapter 4 "Working with Words: Which Word Is Right?"</a>.</p>

Mariah incorporates some of the introductory elements into her introductory paragraph, which she previously outlined in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s01_p07">In your job field, you may be required to write a speech for an event, such as an awards banquet or a dedication ceremony. The introduction of a speech is similar to an essay because you have a limited amount of space to attract your audience’s attention. Using the same techniques, such as a provocative quote or an interesting statistic, is an effective way to engage your listeners. Using the funnel approach also introduces your audience to your topic and then presents your main idea in a logical manner.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing a Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_p01">It is not unusual to want to rush when you approach your conclusion, and even experienced writers may fade. But what good writers remember is that it is vital to put just as much attention into the conclusion as in the rest of the essay. After all, a hasty ending can undermine an otherwise strong essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_p02">A conclusion that does not correspond to the rest of your essay, has loose ends, or is unorganized can unsettle your readers and raise doubts about the entire essay. However, if you have worked hard to write the introduction and body, your conclusion can often be the most logical part to compose.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Anatomy of a Strong Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p01">Keep in mind that the ideas in your conclusion must conform to the rest of your essay. In order to tie these components together, restate your thesis at the beginning of your conclusion. This helps you assemble, in an orderly fashion, all the information you have explained in the body. Repeating your thesis reminds your readers of the major arguments you have been trying to prove and also indicates that your essay is drawing to a close. A strong conclusion also reviews your main points and emphasizes the importance of the topic.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p02">The construction of the conclusion is similar to the introduction, in which you make general introductory statements and then present your thesis. The difference is that in the conclusion you first <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paraphrase</a><span class="glossdef">To restate ideas or information from sources using one’s own words and sentence structures.</span></span>, or state in different words, your thesis and then follow up with general concluding remarks. These sentences should progressively broaden the focus of your thesis and maneuver your readers out of the essay.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p03">Many writers like to end their essays with a final emphatic statement. This strong closing statement will cause your readers to continue thinking about the implications of your essay; it will make your conclusion, and thus your essay, more memorable. Another powerful technique is to challenge your readers to make a change in either their thoughts or their actions. Challenging your readers to see the subject through new eyes is a powerful way to ease yourself and your readers out of the essay.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p04">When closing your essay, do not expressly state that you are drawing to a close. Relying on statements such as <em class="emphasis">in conclusion</em>, <em class="emphasis">it is clear that</em>, <em class="emphasis">as you can see</em>, or <em class="emphasis">in summation</em> is unnecessary and can be considered trite.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p05">It is wise to avoid doing any of the following in your conclusion:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>Introducing new material</li>
                    <li>Contradicting your thesis</li>
                    <li>Changing your thesis</li>
                    <li>Using apologies or disclaimers</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p06">Introducing new material in your conclusion has an unsettling effect on your reader. When you raise new points, you make your reader want more information, which you could not possibly provide in the limited space of your final paragraph.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p07">Contradicting or changing your thesis statement causes your readers to think that you do not actually have a conviction about your topic. After all, you have spent several paragraphs adhering to a singular point of view. When you change sides or open up your point of view in the conclusion, your reader becomes less inclined to believe your original argument.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p08">By apologizing for your opinion or stating that you know it is tough to digest, you are in fact admitting that even you know what you have discussed is irrelevant or unconvincing. You do not want your readers to feel this way. Effective writers stand by their thesis statement and do not stray from it.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p12">Make sure your essay is balanced by not having an excessively long or short introduction or conclusion. Check that they match each other in length as closely as possible, and try to mirror the formula you used in each. Parallelism strengthens the message of your essay.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p13">On the job you will sometimes give oral presentations based on research you have conducted. A concluding statement to an oral report contains the same elements as a written conclusion. You should wrap up your presentation by restating the purpose of the presentation, reviewing its main points, and emphasizing the importance of the material you presented. A strong conclusion will leave a lasting impression on your audience.</p>
