What roles did women play in the American Revolution? How does the human brain create, store, and retrieve memories? Who invented the game of football, and how has it changed over the years?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_p02">You may know the answers to these questions off the top of your head. If you are like most people, however, you find answers to tough questions like these by searching the Internet, visiting the library, or asking others for information. To put it simply, you perform research.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_p03">Whether you are a scientist, an artist, a paralegal, or a parent, you probably perform research in your everyday life. When your boss, your instructor, or a family member asks you a question that you do not know the answer to, you locate relevant information, analyze your findings, and share your results. Locating, analyzing, and sharing information are key steps in the research process, and in this chapter, you will learn more about each step. By developing your research writing skills, you will prepare yourself to answer any question no matter how challenging.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reasons for Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_p01">When you perform research, you are essentially trying to solve a mystery—you want to know how something works or why something happened. In other words, you want to answer a question that you (and other people) have about the world. This is one of the most basic reasons for performing research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_p02">But the research process does not end when you have solved your mystery. Imagine what would happen if a detective collected enough evidence to solve a criminal case, but she never shared her solution with the authorities. Presenting what you have learned from research can be just as important as performing the research. Research results can be presented in a variety of ways, but one of the most popular—and effective—presentation forms is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research paper</a><span class="glossdef">A composition that presents an original thesis about a topic and develops that thesis with information gathered from a variety of sources.</span></span>. A research paper presents an original thesis, or purpose statement, about a topic and develops that thesis with information gathered from a variety of sources.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_p03">If you are curious about the possibility of life on Mars, for example, you might choose to research the topic. What will you do, though, when your research is complete? You will need a way to put your thoughts together in a logical, coherent manner. You may want to use the facts you have learned to create a narrative or to support an argument. And you may want to show the results of your research to your friends, your teachers, or even the editors of magazines and journals. Writing a research paper is an ideal way to organize thoughts, craft narratives or make arguments based on research, and share your newfound knowledge with the world.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p01">No matter what field of study you are interested in, you will most likely be asked to write a research paper during your academic career. For example, a student in an art history course might write a research paper about an artist’s work. Similarly, a student in a psychology course might write a research paper about current findings in childhood development.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_s01_p02">Having to write a research paper may feel intimidating at first. After all, researching and writing a long paper requires a lot of time, effort, and organization. However, writing a research paper can also be a great opportunity to explore a topic that is particularly interesting to you. The research process allows you to gain expertise on a topic of your choice, and the writing process helps you remember what you have learned and understand it on a deeper level.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s01_s02_p01">Knowing how to write a good research paper is a valuable skill that will serve you well throughout your career. Whether you are developing a new product, studying the best way to perform a procedure, or learning about challenges and opportunities in your field of employment, you will use research techniques to guide your exploration. You may even need to create a written report of your findings. And because effective communication is essential to any company, employers seek to hire people who can write clearly and professionally.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_p01">How does a research paper grow from a folder of brainstormed notes to a polished final draft? No two projects are identical, but most projects follow a series of six basic steps.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_p02">These are the steps in the research writing process:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_l01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_p03">Each of these steps will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. For now, though, we will take a brief look at what each step involves.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Choosing a Topic</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p01">As you may recall from <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>, to narrow the focus of your topic, you may try freewriting exercises, such as brainstorming. You may also need to ask a specific <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research question</a><span class="glossdef">A broad, open-ended question that a writer uses to guide the research process. In the research paper, the writer attempts to answer the question thoughtfully.</span></span>—a broad, open-ended question that will guide your research—as well as propose a possible answer, or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">working thesis</a><span class="glossdef">The first thesis statement a writer uses while outlining an assignment. A working thesis statement may change during the writing process.</span></span>. You may use your research question and your working thesis to create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research proposal</a><span class="glossdef">A brief document that includes a writer’s main research question, related subquestions, working thesis, and plan for gathering information.</span></span>. In a research proposal, you present your main research question, any related subquestions you plan to explore, and your working thesis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Planning and Scheduling</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p01">Before you start researching your topic, take time to plan your researching and writing schedule. Research projects can take days, weeks, or even months to complete. Creating a schedule is a good way to ensure that you do not end up being overwhelmed by all the work you have to do as the deadline approaches.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p02">During this step of the process, it is also a good idea to plan the resources and organizational tools you will use to keep yourself on track throughout the project. Flowcharts, calendars, and checklists can all help you stick to your schedule. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11_s02#fresh-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Steps in Developing a Research Proposal"</a> for an example of a research schedule.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Conducting Research</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s03_p01">When going about your research, you will likely use a variety of sources—anything from books and periodicals to video presentations and in-person interviews.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s03_p02">Your sources will include both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary sources</a><span class="glossdef">Research sources that provide raw information or data without commentary or interpretation, such as surveys, interviews, and historical documents.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary sources</a><span class="glossdef">Research sources that provide information and include some analysis or interpretation of the information. Scholarly journals and magazine articles are usually considered secondary sources.</span></span>. Primary sources provide firsthand information or raw data. For example, surveys, in-person interviews, and historical documents are primary sources. Secondary sources, such as biographies, literary reviews, or magazine articles, include some analysis or interpretation of the information presented. As you conduct research, you will take detailed, careful notes about your discoveries. You will also evaluate the reliability of each source you find.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 4: Organizing Research and the Writer’s Ideas</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04_p01">When your research is complete, you will organize your findings and decide which sources to cite in your paper. You will also have an opportunity to evaluate the evidence you have collected and determine whether it supports your thesis, or the focus of your paper. You may decide to adjust your thesis or conduct additional research to ensure that your thesis is well supported.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s04_p02">Remember, your working thesis is not set in stone. You can and should change your working thesis throughout the research writing process if the evidence you find does not support your original thesis. Never try to force evidence to fit your argument. For example, your working thesis is “Mars cannot support life-forms.” Yet, a week into researching your topic, you find an article in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> detailing new findings of bacteria under the Martian surface. Instead of trying to argue that bacteria are not life forms, you might instead alter your thesis to “Mars cannot support complex life-forms.”</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s05">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 5: Drafting Your Paper</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s05_p01">Now you are ready to combine your research findings with your critical analysis of the results in a rough draft. You will incorporate source materials into your paper and discuss each source thoughtfully in relation to your thesis or purpose statement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s05_p02">When you cite your reference sources, it is important to pay close attention to standard conventions for citing sources in order to avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">plagiarism</a><span class="glossdef">The practice of using someone else’s words or ideas without acknowledging the source.</span></span>, or the practice of using someone else’s words without acknowledging the source. Later in this chapter, you will learn how to incorporate sources in your paper and avoid some of the most common pitfalls of attributing information.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 6: Revising and Editing Your Paper</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s06_p01">In the final step of the research writing process, you will revise and polish your paper. You might reorganize your paper’s structure or revise for unity and cohesion, ensuring that each element in your paper flows into the next logically and naturally. You will also make sure that your paper uses an appropriate and consistent tone.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s01_s02_s06_p02">Once you feel confident in the strength of your writing, you will edit your paper for proper spelling, grammar, punctuation, mechanics, and formatting. When you complete this final step, you will have transformed a simple idea or question into a thoroughly researched and well-written paper you can be proud of!</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing a Topic</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_p01">When you choose a topic for a research paper, you are making a major commitment. Your choice will help determine whether you enjoy the lengthy process of research and writing—and whether your final paper fulfills the assignment requirements. If you choose your topic hastily, you may later find it difficult to work with your topic. By taking your time and choosing carefully, you can ensure that this assignment is not only challenging but also rewarding.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Writers understand the importance of choosing a topic that fulfills the assignment requirements and fits the assignment’s purpose and audience. (For more information about purpose and audience, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch06#fresh-ch06">Chapter 6 "Writing Paragraphs: Separating Ideas and Shaping Content"</a>.) Choosing a topic that interests you is also crucial. You instructor may provide a list of suggested topics or ask that you develop a topic on your own. In either case, try to identify topics that genuinely interest you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_p03">After identifying potential topic ideas, you will need to evaluate your ideas and choose one topic to pursue. Will you be able to find enough information about the topic? Can you develop a paper about this topic that presents and supports your original ideas? Is the topic too broad or too narrow for the scope of the assignment? If so, can you modify it so it is more manageable? You will ask these questions during this preliminary phase of the research process.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">Sometimes, your instructor may provide a list of suggested topics. If so, you may benefit from identifying several possibilities before committing to one idea. It is important to know how to narrow down your ideas into a concise, manageable thesis. You may also use the list as a starting point to help you identify additional, related topics. Discussing your ideas with your instructor will help ensure that you choose a manageable topic that fits the requirements of the assignment.</p>

Use brainstorming or idea mapping to create a list of topics you would be interested in researching for a paper about the influence of the Internet on social networking. Do you closely follow the media coverage of a particular website, such as Twitter? Would you like to learn more about a certain industry, such as online dating? Which social networking sites do you and your friends use? List as many ideas related to this topic as you can.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p01">Once you have a list of potential topics, you will need to choose one as the focus of your essay. You will also need to narrow your topic. Most writers find that the topics they listed during brainstorming or idea mapping are broad—too broad for the scope of the assignment. Working with an overly broad topic, such as sexual education programs or popularized diets, can be frustrating and overwhelming. Each topic has so many facets that it would be impossible to cover them all in a college research paper. However, more specific choices, such as the pros and cons of sexual education in kids’ television programs or the physical effects of the South Beach diet, are specific enough to write about without being too narrow to sustain an entire research paper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p02">A good research paper provides focused, in-depth information and analysis. If your topic is too broad, you will find it difficult to do more than skim the surface when you research it and write about it. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Narrowing your focus</a><span class="glossdef">The process of identifying a specific angle from which to approach a broad topic in order to limit it and make it more manageable.</span></span> is essential to making your topic manageable.

To work with your topic successfully, you will need to determine what exactly you want to learn about it—and later, what you want to say about it.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_s01_p01">In forming a research question, you are setting a goal for your research. Your main research question should be substantial enough to form the guiding principle of your paper—but focused enough to guide your research. A strong research question requires you not only to find information but also to put together different pieces of information, interpret and analyze them, and figure out what you think. As you consider potential research questions, ask yourself whether they would be too hard or too easy to answer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_s01_p02">To determine your research question, review the freewriting you completed earlier. Skim through books, articles, and websites and list the questions you have. (You may wish to use the 5WH strategy to help you formulate questions. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> for more information about 5WH questions.) Include simple, factual questions and more complex questions that would require analysis and interpretation.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Planning Your Project</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p01">Each step of a research project requires time and attention. Careful planning helps ensure that you will keep your project running smoothly and produce your best work. Set up a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">project schedule</a><span class="glossdef">A document outlining the tasks involved in each step of the research project with a target date for completing each step.</span></span> that shows when you will complete each step.

Examples of project resources include library databases, personal computers, style guides, and tutors.</span></span> you will use. Resources may include anything from library databases and word-processing software to interview subjects and writing tutors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p02">To develop your schedule, use a calendar and work backward from the date your final draft is due. Generally, it is wise to divide half of the available time on the research phase of the project and half on the writing phase. For example, if you have a month to work, plan for two weeks for each phase. If you have a full semester, plan to begin research early and to start writing by the middle of the term. You might think that no one really works that far ahead, but try it. You will probably be pleased with the quality of your work and with the reduction in your stress level.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p03">As you plan, break down major steps into smaller tasks if necessary. For example, step 3, conducting research, involves locating potential sources, evaluating their usefulness and reliability, reading, and taking notes. Defining these smaller tasks makes the project more manageable by giving you concrete goals to achieve.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s01_p06">Plan your schedule realistically, and consider other commitments that may sometimes take precedence. A business trip or family visit may mean that you are unable to work on the research project for a few days. Make the most of the time you have available. Plan for unexpected interruptions, but keep in mind that a short time away from the project may help you come back to it with renewed enthusiasm. Another strategy many writers find helpful is to finish each day’s work at a point when the next task is an easy one. That makes it easier to start again.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s02_p01">Although setting up a schedule is easy, sticking to one is challenging. Even if you are the rare person who never procrastinates, unforeseen events may interfere with your ability to complete tasks on time. A self-imposed deadline may slip your mind despite your best intentions. Organizational tools—calendars, checklists, note cards, software, and so forth—can help you stay on track.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Throughout your project, organize both your time and your resources systematically. Review your schedule frequently and check your progress. It helps to post your schedule in a place where you will see it every day. Both personal and workplace e-mail systems usually include a calendar feature where you can record tasks, arrange to receive daily reminders, and check off completed tasks. Electronic devices such as smartphones have similar features.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s02_p03">Organize project documents in a binder or electronic folder, and label project documents and folders clearly. Use note cards or an electronic document to record bibliographical information for each source you plan to use in your paper. Tracking this information throughout the research process can save you hours of time when you create your references page.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Anticipating Challenges</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p01">Do any of these scenarios sound familiar? You have identified a book that would be a great resource for your project, but it is currently checked out of the library. You planned to interview a subject matter expert on your topic, but she calls to reschedule your meeting. You have begun writing your draft, but now you realize that you will need to modify your thesis and conduct additional research. Or you have finally completed your draft when your computer crashes, and days of hard work disappear in an instant.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p02">These troubling situations are all too common. No matter how carefully you plan your schedule, you may encounter a glitch or setback. Managing your project effectively means anticipating potential problems, taking steps to minimize them where possible, and allowing time in your schedule to handle any setbacks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p03">Many times a situation becomes a problem due only to lack of planning. For example, if a book is checked out of your local library, it might be available through interlibrary loan, which usually takes a few days for the library staff to process. Alternatively, you might locate another, equally useful source. If you have allowed enough time for research, a brief delay will not become a major setback.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s03_s03_p04">You can manage other potential problems by staying organized and maintaining a take-charge attitude. Take a minute each day to save a backup copy of your work on a portable hard drive. Maintain detailed note cards and source cards as you conduct research—doing so will make citing sources in your draft infinitely easier. If you run into difficulties with your research or your writing, ask your instructor for help, or make an appointment with a writing tutor.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Locating Useful Resources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s01_p01">When you chose a paper topic and determined your research questions, you conducted preliminary research to stimulate your thinking. Your research proposal included some general ideas for how to go about your research—for instance, interviewing an expert in the field or analyzing the content of popular magazines. You may even have identified a few potential sources. Now it is time to conduct a more focused, systematic search for informative primary and secondary sources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Primary and Secondary Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p01">Writers classify research resources in two categories: primary sources and secondary sources. <em class="emphasis">Primary sources</em> are direct, firsthand sources of information or data. For example, if you were writing a paper about the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, the text of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights would be a primary source.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p02">Other primary sources include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Research articles</li>
            <li>Literary texts</li>
            <li>Historical documents such as diaries or letters</li>
            <li>Autobiographies or other personal accounts</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p03"><em class="emphasis">Secondary sources</em> discuss, interpret, analyze, consolidate, or otherwise rework information from primary sources. In researching a paper about the First Amendment, you might read articles about legal cases that involved First Amendment rights, or editorials expressing commentary on the First Amendment. These sources would be considered secondary sources because they are one step removed from the primary source of information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p04">The following are examples of secondary sources:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_l02">
            <li>Magazine articles</li>
            <li>Biographical books</li>
            <li>Literary and scientific reviews</li>
            <li>Television documentaries</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p05">Your topic and purpose determine whether you must cite both primary and secondary sources in your paper. Ask yourself which sources are most likely to provide the information that will answer your research questions. If you are writing a research paper about reality television shows, you will need to use some reality shows as a primary source, but secondary sources, such as a reviewer’s critique, are also important. If you are writing about the health effects of nicotine, you will probably want to read the published results of scientific studies, but secondary sources, such as magazine articles discussing the outcome of a recent study, may also be helpful.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_p06">Once you have thought about what kinds of sources are most likely to help you answer your research questions, you may begin your search for print and electronic resources. The challenge here is to conduct your search efficiently. Writers use strategies to help them find the sources that are most relevant and reliable while steering clear of sources that will not be useful.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s02_p01">When you search for periodicals, be sure to distinguish among different types. Mass-market publications, such as newspapers and popular magazines, differ from scholarly publications in their accessibility, audience, and purpose.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s02_p02">Newspapers and magazines are written for a broader audience than scholarly journals. Their content is usually quite accessible and easy to read. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Trade magazines</a><span class="glossdef">Magazines that address topics relevant to a particular industry.</span></span> that target readers within a particular industry may presume the reader has background knowledge, but these publications are still reader-friendly for a broader audience.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Scholarly or academic journals</a><span class="glossdef">Periodicals that address topics in a specialized field and are geared toward an audience with prior expertise in the field.</span></span> are written for a much smaller and more expert audience. The creators of these publications assume that most of their readers are already familiar with the main topic of the journal. The target audience is also highly educated. Informing is the primary purpose of a scholarly journal. While a journal article may advance an agenda or advocate a position, the content will still be presented in an objective style and formal tone. Entertaining readers with breezy comments and splashy graphics is not a priority.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s02_p04">Because of these differences, scholarly journals are more challenging to read. That doesn’t mean you should avoid them. On the contrary, they can provide in-depth information unavailable elsewhere. Because knowledgeable professionals carefully review the content before publication, scholarly journals are far more reliable than much of the information available in popular media. Seek out academic journals along with other resources. Just be prepared to spend a little more time processing the information.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s03_p04">One way to refine your keyword search is to use Boolean operators. These operators allow you to combine keywords, find variations on a word, and otherwise expand or limit your results. Here are some of the ways you can use Boolean operators:</p>
                    <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s01_s03_l02">
                        <li>Combine keywords with <strong class="emphasis bold">and</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">+</strong> to limit results to citations that include both keywords—for example, <strong class="emphasis bold">diet + nutrition</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Combine keywords with <strong class="emphasis bold">not</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">-</strong> to search for the first word without the second. This can help you eliminate irrelevant results based on words that are similar to your search term. For example, searching for <strong class="emphasis bold">obesity not childhood</strong> locates materials on obesity but excludes materials on childhood obesity.</li>
                        <li>Enclose a phrase in quotation marks to search for an exact phrase, such as “<strong class="emphasis bold">morbid obesity</strong>.”</li>
                        <li>Use parentheses to direct the order of operations in a search string. For example, since Type II diabetes is also known as adult-onset diabetes, you could search <strong class="emphasis bold">(Type II or adult-onset) and diabetes</strong> to limit your search results to articles on this form of the disease.</li>
                        <li>Use a wildcard symbol such as <strong class="emphasis bold">#</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">?</strong>, or <strong class="emphasis bold">$</strong> after a word to search for variations on a term. For instance, you might type <strong class="emphasis bold">diabet#</strong> to search for information on diabetes and diabetics. The specific symbol used varies with different databases.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s02_s01_p01">When faced with the challenge of writing a research paper, some students rely on popular search engines as their first source of information. Typing a keyword or phrase into a search engine instantly pulls up links to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of related websites—what could be easier? Unfortunately, despite its apparent convenience, this research strategy has the following drawbacks to consider:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Results do not always appear in order of reliability.</strong> The first few hits that appear in search results may include sites whose content is not always reliable, such as online encyclopedias that can be edited by any user. Because websites are created by third parties, the search engine cannot tell you which sites have accurate information.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Results may be too numerous for you to use.</strong> The amount of information available on the web is far greater than the amount of information housed within a particular library or database. Realistically, if your web search pulls up thousands of hits, you will not be able to visit every site—and the most useful sites may be buried deep within your search results.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Search engines are not connected to the results of the search.</strong> Search engines find websites that people visit often and list the results in order of popularity. The search engine, then, is not connected to any of the results. When you cite a source found through a search engine, you do not need to cite the search engine. Only cite the source.</li>

Consider whether you could use a person or group as a primary source. For instance, you might interview a professor who has expertise in a particular subject, a worker within a particular industry, or a representative from a political organization. Interviews can be a great way to get firsthand information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s02_s03_p02">To get the most out of an interview, you will need to plan ahead. Contact your subject early in the research process and explain your purpose for requesting an interview. Prepare detailed questions. Open-ended questions, rather than questions with simple yes-or-no answers, are more likely to lead to an in-depth discussion. Schedule a time to meet, and be sure to obtain your subject’s permission to record the interview. Take careful notes and be ready to ask follow-up questions based on what you learn.</p>

It is easy for writers to get so caught up in checking out books and printing out articles that they forget to ask themselves how they will use these resources in their research. Now is a good time to get a little ruthless. Reading and taking notes takes time and energy, so you will want to focus on the most relevant sources.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s01_p02">To weed through your stack of books and articles, skim their contents. Read quickly with your research questions and subtopics in mind. <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s01_t01">Table 11.3 "Tips for Skimming Books and Articles"</a> explains how to skim to get a quick sense of what topics are covered. If a book or article is not especially relevant, put it aside. You can always come back to it later if you need to.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_p01">All information sources are not created equal. Sources can vary greatly in terms of how carefully they are researched, written, edited, and reviewed for accuracy. Common sense will help you identify obviously questionable sources, such as tabloids that feature tales of alien abductions, or personal websites with glaring typos. Sometimes, however, a source’s reliability—or lack of it—is not so obvious. For more information about source reliability, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch12#fresh-ch12">Chapter 12 "Writing a Research Paper"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_p02">To evaluate your research sources, you will use critical thinking skills consciously and deliberately. You will consider criteria such as the type of source, its intended purpose and audience, the author’s (or authors’) qualifications, the publication’s reputation, any indications of bias or hidden agendas, how current the source is, and the overall quality of the writing, thinking, and design.</p>

They usually appear among the first few results of a web search. They cover thousands of topics, and many articles use an informal, straightforward writing style. Unfortunately, these sites have no control system for researching, writing, and reviewing articles. Instead, they rely on a community of users to police themselves. At best, these sites can be a starting point for finding other, more trustworthy sources. Never use them as final sources.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s02_p02">Keep in mind that expertise in one field is no guarantee of expertise in another, unrelated area.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s03_s02_s02_p03">Just as important as the author’s credibility is the publication’s overall reputability. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Reputability</a><span class="glossdef">A publication’s established reputation as a respectable, reliable source of information.</span></span> refers to a source’s standing and reputation as a respectable, reliable source of information.

Depending on the topic, sources may become outdated relatively soon after publication, or they may remain useful for years. For instance, online social networking sites have evolved rapidly over the past few years. An article published in 2002 about this topic will not provide current information.

Many sites publish this information on the homepage, and some, such as news sites, are updated daily or weekly. Many nonfunctioning links are a sign that a website is not regularly updated.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s01_p02">As you begin typing your list, you realize you need to include the publication information for a book you cited frequently. Unfortunately, you already returned it to the library several days ago. You do not remember the URLs for some of the websites you used or the dates you accessed them—information that also must be included in your bibliography. With a sinking feeling, you realize that finding this information and preparing your bibliography will require hours of work.</p>

Taking time to organize source information now will ensure that you are not scrambling to find it at the last minute. Throughout your research, record bibliographical information for each source as soon as you begin using it.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_p01">Good researchers stay focused and organized as they gather information from sources. Before you begin taking notes, take a moment to step back and think about your goal as a researcher—to find information that will help you answer your research question. When you write your paper, you will present your conclusions about the topic supported by research. That goal will determine what information you record and how you organize it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_p02">Writers sometimes get caught up in taking extensive notes, so much so that they lose sight of how their notes relate to the questions and ideas they started out with. Remember that you do not need to write down every detail from your reading. Focus on finding and recording details that will help you answer your research questions. The following strategies will help you take notes efficiently.</p>

Keep all your notes in one file, digital or otherwise. Doing so will help you identify connections among different pieces of information. It will also help you make connections between your notes and the research questions and subtopics you identified earlier.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s02_p01">Your notes will fall under three categories—summary notes, paraphrased information, and direct quotations from your sources.

                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s02_p02">Most of your notes should be paraphrased from the original source. Paraphrasing as you take notes is usually a better strategy than copying direct quotations, because it forces you to think through the information in your source and understand it well enough to restate it. In short, it helps you stay engaged with the material instead of simply copying and pasting. Synthesizing will help you later when you begin planning and drafting your paper. (For detailed guidelines on summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11_s06#fresh-ch11_s06">Section 11.6 "Writing from Research: End-of-Chapter Exercises"</a>.)</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_p01">Regardless of the format used, any notes you take should include enough information to help you organize ideas and locate them instantly in the original text if you need to review them. Make sure your notes include the following elements:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_l01">
                    <li>Heading summing up the main topic covered</li>
                    <li>Author’s name, a source code, or an abbreviated source title</li>
                    <li>Page number</li>
                    <li>Full URL of any pages buried deep in a website</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_p02">Throughout the process of taking notes, be scrupulous about making sure you have correctly attributed each idea to its source. Always include source information so you know exactly which ideas came from which sources. Use quotation marks to set off any words for phrases taken directly from the original text. If you add your own responses and ideas, make sure they are distinct from ideas you quoted or paraphrased.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s03_p03">Finally, make sure your notes accurately reflect the content of the original text. Make sure quoted material is copied verbatim. If you omit words from a quotation, use ellipses to show the omission and make sure the omission does not change the author’s meaning. Paraphrase ideas carefully, and check your paraphrased notes against the original text to make sure that you have restated the author’s ideas accurately in your own words.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s04_p01">There are several formats you can use to take notes. No technique is necessarily better than the others—it is more important to choose a format you are comfortable using. Choosing the format that works best for you will ensure your notes are organized, complete, and accurate. Consider implementing one of these formats when you begin taking notes:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s04_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use index cards.</strong> This traditional format involves writing each note on a separate index card. It takes more time than copying and pasting into an electronic document, which encourages you to be selective in choosing which ideas to record. Recording notes on separate cards makes it easy to later organize your notes according to major topics. Some writers color-code their cards to make them still more organized.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use note-taking software.</strong> Word-processing and office software packages often include different types of note-taking software. Although you may need to set aside some time to learn the software, this method combines the speed of typing with the same degree of organization associated with handwritten note cards.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Maintain a research notebook.</strong> Instead of using index cards or electronic note cards, you may wish to keep a notebook or electronic folder, allotting a few pages (or one file) for each of your sources. This method makes it easy to create a separate column or section of the document where you add your responses to the information you encounter in your research.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Annotate your sources.</strong> This method involves making handwritten notes in the margins of sources that you have printed or photocopied. If using electronic sources, you can make comments within the source document. For example, you might add comment boxes to a PDF version of an article. This method works best for experienced researchers who have already thought a great deal about the topic because it can be difficult to organize your notes later when starting your draft.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s04_s04_s02_s04_p02">Choose one of the methods from the list to use for taking notes. Continue gathering sources and taking notes.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_p02">Beginning writers sometimes attempt to transform a pile of note cards into a formal research paper without any intermediary step. This approach presents problems. The writer’s original question and thesis may be buried in a flood of disconnected details taken from research sources. The first draft may present redundant or contradictory information. Worst of all, the writer’s ideas and voice may be lost.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_p03">An effective research paper focuses on the writer’s ideas—from the question that sparked the research process to how the writer answers that question based on the research findings. Before beginning a draft, or even an outline, good writers pause and reflect. They ask themselves questions such as the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_l02">
        <li>How has my thinking changed based on my research? What have I learned?</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_p02">When you conduct research, you keep an open mind and seek out many promising sources. You take notes on any information that looks like it might help you answer your research questions. Often, new ideas and terms come up in your reading, and these, too, find their way into your notes. You may record facts or quotations that catch your attention even if they did not seem immediately relevant to your research question. By now, you have probably amassed an impressively detailed collection of notes.</p>

They look at multiple perspectives, facts, and ideas related to their topic, and they gather a great deal of information. Effective writers, however, are selective. They determine which information is most relevant and appropriate for their purpose. They include details that develop or explain their ideas—and they leave out details that do not. The writer, not the pile of notes, is the controlling force. The writer shapes the content of the research paper.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Is the link between this information and my thesis obvious—or will I need to explain it to my readers?</strong> Remember, you have spent more time thinking and reading about this topic than your audience. Some connections might be obvious to both you and your readers. More often, however, you will need to provide the analysis or explanation that shows how the information supports your thesis. As you read through your notes, jot down ideas you have for making those connections clear.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">What personal biases or experiences might affect the way I interpret this information?</strong> No researcher is 100 percent objective.

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s01_p03">It can be tempting to ignore information that does not support your thesis or that contradicts it outright. However, such information is important. At the very least, it gives you a sense of what has been written about the issue. More importantly, it can help you question and refine your own thinking so that writing your research paper is a true learning process.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Find Connections between Your Sources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p01">As you find connections between your ideas and information in your sources, also look for information that connects your sources. Do most sources seem to agree on a particular idea? Are some facts mentioned repeatedly in many different sources? What key terms or major concepts come up in most of your sources regardless of whether the sources agree on the finer points? Identifying these connections will help you identify important ideas to discuss in your paper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p02">Look for subtler ways your sources complement one another, too. Does one author refer to another’s book or article? How do sources that are more recent build upon the ideas developed in earlier sources?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p03">Be aware of any redundancies in your sources. If you have amassed solid support from a reputable source, such as a scholarly journal, there is no need to cite the same facts from an online encyclopedia article that is many steps removed from any primary research. If a given source adds nothing new to your discussion and you can cite a stronger source for the same information, use the stronger source.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p04">Determine how you will address any contradictions found among different sources. For instance, if one source cites a startling fact that you cannot confirm anywhere else, it is safe to dismiss the information as unreliable. However, if you find significant disagreements among reliable sources, you will need to review them and evaluate each source. Which source presents a sounder argument or more solid evidence? It is up to you to determine which source is the most credible and why.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p05">Finally, do not ignore any information simply because it does not support your thesis. Carefully consider how that information fits into the big picture of your research. You may decide that the source is unreliable or the information is not relevant, or you may decide that it is an important point you need to bring up. What matters is that you give it careful consideration.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s02_p06">As Jorge reviewed his research, he realized that some of the information was not especially useful for his purpose. His notes included several statements about the relationship between soft drinks that are high in sugar and childhood obesity—a subtopic that was too far outside of the main focus of the paper. Jorge decided to cut this material.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Reevaluate Your Working Thesis</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s03_p01">A careful analysis of your notes will help you reevaluate your working thesis and determine whether you need to revise it. Remember that your working thesis was the starting point—not necessarily the end point—of your research. You should revise your working thesis if your ideas changed based on what you read. Even if your sources generally confirmed your preliminary thinking on the topic, it is still a good idea to tweak the wording of your thesis to incorporate the specific details you learned from research.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s01_s03_p02">Jorge realized that his working thesis oversimplified the issues. He still believed that the media was exaggerating the benefits of low-carb diets. However, his research led him to conclude that these diets did have some advantages. Read Jorge’s revised thesis.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Synthesizing and Organizing Information</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_p01">By now your thinking on your topic is taking shape. You have a sense of what major ideas to address in your paper, what points you can easily support, and what questions or subtopics might need a little more thought. In short, you have begun the process of synthesizing information—that is, of putting the pieces together into a coherent whole.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_p02">It is normal to find this part of the process a little difficult. Some questions or concepts may still be unclear to you. You may not yet know how you will tie all of your research together. Synthesizing information is a complex, demanding mental task, and even experienced researchers struggle with it at times. A little uncertainty is often a good sign! It means you are challenging yourself to work thoughtfully with your topic instead of simply restating the same information.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Use Your Research Questions to Synthesize Information</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p01">You have already considered how your notes fit with your working thesis. Now, take your synthesis a step further. Analyze how your notes relate to your major research question and the subquestions you identified in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11_s02#fresh-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Steps in Developing a Research Proposal"</a>. Organize your notes with headings that correspond to those questions. As you proceed, you might identify some important subtopics that were not part of your original plan, or you might decide that some questions are not relevant to your paper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p02">Categorize information carefully and continue to think critically about the material. Ask yourself whether the sources are reliable and whether the connections between ideas are clear.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p03">Remember, your ideas and conclusions will shape the paper. They are the glue that holds the rest of the content together. As you work, begin jotting down the big ideas you will use to connect the dots for your reader. (If you are not sure where to begin, try answering your major research question and subquestions. Add and answer new questions as appropriate.) You might record these big ideas on sticky notes or type and highlight them within an electronic document.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s05_s02_s01_p04">Jorge looked back on the list of research questions that he had written down earlier. He changed a few to match his new thesis, and he began a rough outline for his paper.</p>

That is fine, as long as you explain what those details mean or how they are linked. You should also include sentences and transitions that show the relationship between different facts from your research by grouping related ideas or pointing out connections or contrasts. The result is that you are not simply presenting information; you are synthesizing, analyzing, and interpreting it.</p>

For some assignments, this may be determined by the instructor’s requirements. For instance, if you are asked to explore the impact of a new communications device, a cause-and-effect structure is obviously appropriate. In other cases, you will need to determine the structure based on what suits your topic and purpose.
