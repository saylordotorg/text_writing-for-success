            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p01">Another method of joining two independent clauses with related and equal ideas is to use a conjunctive adverb and a semicolon (see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch02#fresh-ch02">Chapter 2 "Writing Basics: What Makes a Good Sentence?"</a> for information on semicolon usage). A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conjunctive adverb</a><span class="glossdef">An adverb that connects two clauses by describing the relationship between them.</span></span> is a linking word that demonstrates a relationship between two clauses.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p03">Since these sentences contain two equal and related ideas, they may be joined using a conjunctive adverb. Now, read the revised sentence:</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p11">When writing an essay or a report, it is important that you do not use excessive coordination. Workplace documents should be clear and concise, so only join two clauses that are logically connected and can work together to make one main point. If you repeat the same coordinating conjunction several times in a sentence, you are probably including more than one idea. This may make it difficult for readers to pick out the most important information in each sentence.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s02_s02_p05">In the revised version, we now have an independent clause (<em class="emphasis">she stopped to help the injured man</em>) that stands as a complete sentence and a dependent clause (<em class="emphasis">even though Tracy would be late for work</em>) that is subordinate to the main clause. Notice that the revised sentence emphasizes the fact that Tracy stopped to help the injured man, rather than the fact she would be late for work. We could also write the sentence this way:</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s02_s02_p08">To punctuate sentences correctly, look at the position of the main clause and the subordinate clause. If a subordinate clause precedes the main clause, use a comma. If the subordinate clause follows the main cause, no punctuation is required.</p>
