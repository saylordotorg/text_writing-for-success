    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_p01">Writing a good research paper takes time, thought, and effort. Although this assignment is challenging, it is manageable. Focusing on one step at a time will help you develop a thoughtful, informative, well-supported research paper.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_p02">Your first step is to choose a topic and then to develop research questions, a working thesis, and a written research proposal. Set aside adequate time for this part of the process. Fully exploring ideas will help you build a solid foundation for your paper.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing a Topic</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_p01">When you choose a topic for a research paper, you are making a major commitment. Your choice will help determine whether you enjoy the lengthy process of research and writing—and whether your final paper fulfills the assignment requirements. If you choose your topic hastily, you may later find it difficult to work with your topic. By taking your time and choosing carefully, you can ensure that this assignment is not only challenging but also rewarding.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Writers understand the importance of choosing a topic that fulfills the assignment requirements and fits the assignment’s purpose and audience. (For more information about purpose and audience, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch06#fresh-ch06">Chapter 6 "Writing Paragraphs: Separating Ideas and Shaping Content"</a>.) Choosing a topic that interests you is also crucial. You instructor may provide a list of suggested topics or ask that you develop a topic on your own. In either case, try to identify topics that genuinely interest you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_p03">After identifying potential topic ideas, you will need to evaluate your ideas and choose one topic to pursue. Will you be able to find enough information about the topic? Can you develop a paper about this topic that presents and supports your original ideas? Is the topic too broad or too narrow for the scope of the assignment? If so, can you modify it so it is more manageable? You will ask these questions during this preliminary phase of the research process.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Identifying Potential Topics</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">Sometimes, your instructor may provide a list of suggested topics. If so, you may benefit from identifying several possibilities before committing to one idea. It is important to know how to narrow down your ideas into a concise, manageable thesis. You may also use the list as a starting point to help you identify additional, related topics. Discussing your ideas with your instructor will help ensure that you choose a manageable topic that fits the requirements of the assignment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p02">In this chapter, you will follow a writer named Jorge, who is studying health care administration, as he prepares a research paper. You will also plan, research, and draft your own research paper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p03">Jorge was assigned to write a research paper on health and the media for an introductory course in health care. Although a general topic was selected for the students, Jorge had to decide which specific issues interested him. He brainstormed a list of possibilities.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p05">Set a timer for five minutes. Use brainstorming or idea mapping to create a list of topics you would be interested in researching for a paper about the influence of the Internet on social networking. Do you closely follow the media coverage of a particular website, such as Twitter? Would you like to learn more about a certain industry, such as online dating? Which social networking sites do you and your friends use? List as many ideas related to this topic as you can.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Narrowing Your Topic</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p01">Once you have a list of potential topics, you will need to choose one as the focus of your essay. You will also need to narrow your topic. Most writers find that the topics they listed during brainstorming or idea mapping are broad—too broad for the scope of the assignment. Working with an overly broad topic, such as sexual education programs or popularized diets, can be frustrating and overwhelming. Each topic has so many facets that it would be impossible to cover them all in a college research paper. However, more specific choices, such as the pros and cons of sexual education in kids’ television programs or the physical effects of the South Beach diet, are specific enough to write about without being too narrow to sustain an entire research paper.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p02">A good research paper provides focused, in-depth information and analysis. If your topic is too broad, you will find it difficult to do more than skim the surface when you research it and write about it. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Narrowing your focus</a><span class="glossdef">The process of identifying a specific angle from which to approach a broad topic in order to limit it and make it more manageable.</span></span> is essential to making your topic manageable. To narrow your focus, explore your topic in writing, conduct preliminary research, and discuss both the topic and the research with others.</p>

Review your list and identify your top two or three topics. Set aside some time to explore each one through freewriting. (For more information about freewriting, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>.) Simply taking the time to focus on your topic may yield fresh angles.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s01_p02">Jorge knew that he was especially interested in the topic of diet fads, but he also knew that it was much too broad for his assignment.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s02_p01">Another way writers may focus a topic is to conduct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">preliminary research</a><span class="glossdef">Research conducted early in the writing process for the purpose of exploring a topic and narrowing the focus.</span></span>. Like freewriting, exploratory reading can help you identify interesting angles. Surfing the web and browsing through newspaper and magazine articles are good ways to start. Find out what people are saying about your topic on blogs and online discussion groups. Discussing your topic with others can also inspire you. Talk about your ideas with your classmates, your friends, or your instructor.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s02_p02">Jorge’s freewriting exercise helped him realize that the assigned topic of health and the media intersected with a few of his interests—diet, nutrition, and obesity. Preliminary online research and discussions with his classmates strengthened his impression that many people are confused or misled by media coverage of these subjects.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s02_p03">Jorge decided to focus his paper on a topic that had garnered a great deal of media attention—low-carbohydrate diets. He wanted to find out whether low-carbohydrate diets were as effective as their proponents claimed.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s02_p04">At work, you may need to research a topic quickly to find general information. This information can be useful in understanding trends in a given industry or generating competition. For example, a company may research a competitor’s prices and use the information when pricing their own product. You may find it useful to skim a variety of reliable sources and take notes on your findings.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s02_p05">The reliability of online sources varies greatly. In this exploratory phase of your research, you do not need to evaluate sources as closely as you will later. However, use common sense as you refine your paper topic. If you read a fascinating blog comment that gives you a new idea for your paper, be sure to check out other, more reliable sources as well to make sure the idea is worth pursuing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Plan for Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_p01">Your freewriting and preliminary research have helped you choose a focused, manageable topic for your research paper. To work with your topic successfully, you will need to determine what exactly you want to learn about it—and later, what you want to say about it. Before you begin conducting in-depth research, you will further define your focus by developing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">research question</a><span class="glossdef">A broad, open-ended question that a writer uses to guide the research process. In the research paper, the writer attempts to answer the question thoughtfully.</span></span>, a working thesis, and a research proposal.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Formulating a Research Question</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_s01_p01">In forming a research question, you are setting a goal for your research. Your main research question should be substantial enough to form the guiding principle of your paper—but focused enough to guide your research. A strong research question requires you not only to find information but also to put together different pieces of information, interpret and analyze them, and figure out what you think. As you consider potential research questions, ask yourself whether they would be too hard or too easy to answer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_s01_p02">To determine your research question, review the freewriting you completed earlier. Skim through books, articles, and websites and list the questions you have. (You may wish to use the 5WH strategy to help you formulate questions. See <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> for more information about 5WH questions.) Include simple, factual questions and more complex questions that would require analysis and interpretation. Determine your main question—the primary focus of your paper—and several subquestions that you will need to research to answer your main question.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_s01_p03">Here are the research questions Jorge will use to focus his research.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch11_s02_s02_s02_p01">A working thesis concisely states a writer’s initial answer to the main research question. It does not merely state a fact or present a subjective opinion. Instead, it expresses a debatable idea or claim that you hope to prove through additional research. Your working thesis is called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">working thesis</a><span class="glossdef">The first, preliminary thesis statement that a writer uses while outlining an essay. A working thesis statement may change during the writing process.</span></span> for a reason—it is subject to change. As you learn more about your topic, you may change your thinking in light of your research findings. Let your working thesis serve as a guide to your research, but do not be afraid to modify it based on what you learn.</p>
