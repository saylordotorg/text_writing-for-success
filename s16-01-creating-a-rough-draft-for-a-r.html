    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_p01">At last, you are ready to begin writing the rough draft of your research paper. Putting your thinking and research into words is exciting. It can also be challenging. In this section, you will learn strategies for handling the more challenging aspects of writing a research paper, such as integrating material from your sources, citing information correctly, and avoiding any misuse of your sources.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Structure of a Research Paper</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_p01">Research papers generally follow the same basic structure: an introduction that presents the writer’s thesis, a body section that develops the thesis with supporting points and evidence, and a conclusion that revisits the thesis and provides additional insights or suggestions for further research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Your writing voice will come across most strongly in your introduction and conclusion, as you work to attract your readers’ interest and establish your thesis. These sections usually do not cite sources at length. They focus on the big picture, not specific details. In contrast, the body of your paper will cite sources extensively. As you present your ideas, you will support your points with details from your research.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Writing Your Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p01">There are several approaches to writing an introduction, each of which fulfills the same goals. The introduction should get readers’ attention, provide background information, and present the writer’s thesis. Many writers like to begin with one of the following catchy openers:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>A surprising fact</li>
                <li>A thought-provoking question</li>
                <li>An attention-getting quote</li>
                <li>A brief anecdote that illustrates a larger concept</li>
                <li>A connection between your topic and your readers’ experiences</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p02">The next few sentences place the opening in context by presenting background information. From there, the writer builds toward a thesis, which is traditionally placed at the end of the introduction. Think of your thesis as a signpost that lets readers know in what direction the paper is headed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p03">Jorge decided to begin his research paper by connecting his topic to readers’ daily experiences. Read the first draft of his introduction. The thesis is underlined. Note how Jorge progresses from the opening sentences to background information to his thesis.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Beyond the Hype: Evaluating Low-Carb Diets</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p04">I. Introduction</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p05">Over the past decade, increasing numbers of Americans have jumped on the low-carb bandwagon. Some studies estimate that approximately 40 million Americans, or about 20 percent of the population, are attempting to restrict their intake of food high in carbohydrates (Sanders and Katz, 2004; Hirsch, 2004). Proponents of low-carb diets say they are not only the most effective way to lose weight, but they also yield health benefits such as lower blood pressure and improved cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, some doctors claim that low-carb diets are overrated and caution that their long-term effects are unknown. <span class="token">Although following a low-carbohydrate diet can benefit some people, these diets are not necessarily the best option for everyone who wants to lose weight or improve their health.</span></p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p07">Writers often work out of sequence when writing a research paper. If you find yourself struggling to write an engaging introduction, you may wish to write the body of your paper first. Writing the body sections first will help you clarify your main points. Writing the introduction should then be easier. You may have a better sense of how to introduce the paper after you have drafted some or all of the body.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Writing Your Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p01">In your introduction, you tell readers where they are headed. In your conclusion, you recap where they have been. For this reason, some writers prefer to write their conclusions soon after they have written their introduction. However, this method may not work for all writers. Other writers prefer to write their conclusion at the end of the paper, after writing the body paragraphs. No process is absolutely right or absolutely wrong; find the one that best suits you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p02">No matter when you compose the conclusion, it should sum up your main ideas and revisit your thesis. The conclusion should not simply echo the introduction or rely on bland summary statements, such as “In this paper, I have demonstrated that.…” In fact, avoid repeating your thesis verbatim from the introduction. Restate it in different words that reflect the new perspective gained through your research. That helps keep your ideas fresh for your readers. An effective writer might conclude a paper by asking a new question the research inspired, revisiting an anecdote presented earlier, or reminding readers of how the topic relates to their lives.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p03">If your job involves writing or reading scientific papers, it helps to understand how professional researchers use the structure described in this section. A scientific paper begins with an abstract that briefly summarizes the entire paper. The introduction explains the purpose of the research, briefly summarizes previous research, and presents the researchers’ hypothesis. The body provides details about the study, such as who participated in it, what the researchers measured, and what results they recorded. The conclusion presents the researchers’ interpretation of the data, or what they learned.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Source Material in Your Paper</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p01">One of the challenges of writing a research paper is successfully integrating your ideas with material from your sources. Your paper must explain what you think, or it will read like a disconnected string of facts and quotations. However, you also need to support your ideas with research, or they will seem insubstantial. How do you strike the right balance?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p02">You have already taken a step in the right direction by writing your introduction. The introduction and conclusion function like the frame around a picture. They define and limit your topic and place your research in context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p03">In the body paragraphs of your paper, you will need to integrate ideas carefully at the paragraph level and at the sentence level. You will use topic sentences in your paragraphs to make sure readers understand the significance of any facts, details, or quotations you cite. You will also include sentences that transition between ideas from your research, either within a paragraph or between paragraphs. At the sentence level, you will need to think carefully about how you introduce paraphrased and quoted material.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p04">Earlier you learned about summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting when taking notes. In the next few sections, you will learn how to use these techniques in the body of your paper to weave in source material to support your ideas.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Summarizing Sources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p01">When you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summarize</a><span class="glossdef">To concisely restate in one’s own words the main ideas from a source.</span></span> material from a source, you zero in on the main points and restate them concisely in your own words. This technique is appropriate when only the major ideas are relevant to your paper or when you need to simplify complex information into a few key points for your readers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p02">Be sure to review the source material as you summarize it. Identify the main idea and restate it as concisely as you can—preferably in one sentence. Depending on your purpose, you may also add another sentence or two condensing any important details or examples. Check your summary to make sure it is accurate and complete.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p03">In his draft, Jorge summarized research materials that presented scientists’ findings about low-carbohydrate diets. Read the following passage from a trade magazine article and Jorge’s summary of the article.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Assessing the Efficacy of Low-Carbohydrate Diets</h3>
                <p class="simpara">Adrienne Howell, Ph.D.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p04">Over the past few years, a number of clinical studies have explored whether high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are more effective for weight loss than other frequently recommended diet plans, such as diets that drastically curtail fat intake (Pritikin) or that emphasize consuming lean meats, grains, vegetables, and a moderate amount of unsaturated fats (the Mediterranean diet). A 2009 study found that obese teenagers who followed a low-carbohydrate diet lost an average of 15.6 kilograms over a six-month period, whereas teenagers following a low-fat diet or a Mediterranean diet lost an average of 11.1 kilograms and 9.3 kilograms respectively. Two 2010 studies that measured weight loss for obese adults following these same three diet plans found similar results. Over three months, subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet plan lost anywhere from four to six kilograms more than subjects who followed other diet plans.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p05">In three recent studies, researchers compared outcomes for obese subjects who followed either a low-carbohydrate diet, a low-fat diet, or a Mediterranean diet and found that subjects following a low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight in the same time (Howell, 2010).</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p06">A summary restates ideas in your own words—but for specialized or clinical terms, you may need to use terms that appear in the original source. For instance, Jorge used the term <em class="emphasis">obese</em> in his summary because related words such as <em class="emphasis">heavy</em> or <em class="emphasis">overweight</em> have a different clinical meaning.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p07">On a separate sheet of paper, practice summarizing by writing a one-sentence summary of the same passage that Jorge already summarized.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Paraphrasing Sources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p01">When you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paraphrase</a><span class="glossdef">To restate ideas or information from sources using one’s own words and sentence structures.</span></span> material from a source, restate the information from an entire sentence or passage in your own words, using your own original sentence structure. A paraphrased source differs from a summarized source in that you focus on restating the ideas, not condensing them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p02">Again, it is important to check your paraphrase against the source material to make sure it is both accurate and original. Inexperienced writers sometimes use the thesaurus method of paraphrasing—that is, they simply rewrite the source material, replacing most of the words with synonyms. This constitutes a misuse of sources. A true paraphrase restates ideas using the writer’s own language and style.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p03">In his draft, Jorge frequently paraphrased details from sources. At times, he needed to rewrite a sentence more than once to ensure he was paraphrasing ideas correctly. Read the passage from a website. Then read Jorge’s initial attempt at paraphrasing it, followed by the final version of his paraphrase.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_n01">

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p06">After reviewing the paraphrased sentence, Jorge realized he was following the original source too closely. He did not want to quote the full passage verbatim, so he again attempted to restate the idea in his own style.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Quoting Sources Directly</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p01">Most of the time, you will summarize or paraphrase source material instead of quoting directly. Doing so shows that you understand your research well enough to write about it confidently in your own words. However, direct quotes can be powerful when used sparingly and with purpose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p02">Quoting directly can sometimes help you make a point in a colorful way. If an author’s words are especially vivid, memorable, or well phrased, quoting them may help hold your reader’s interest. Direct quotations from an interviewee or an eyewitness may help you personalize an issue for readers. And when you analyze primary sources, such as a historical speech or a work of literature, quoting extensively is often necessary to illustrate your points. These are valid reasons to use quotations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p03">Less experienced writers, however, sometimes overuse direct quotations in a research paper because it seems easier than paraphrasing. At best, this reduces the effectiveness of the quotations. At worst, it results in a paper that seems haphazardly pasted together from outside sources. Use quotations sparingly for greater impact.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p04">When you do choose to quote directly from a source, follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_l01">
                <li>Make sure you have transcribed the original statement accurately.</li>
                <li>Represent the author’s ideas honestly. Quote enough of the original text to reflect the author’s point accurately.</li>
                <li>Never use a stand-alone quotation. Always integrate the quoted material into your own sentence.</li>
                <li>Use ellipses (…) if you need to omit a word or phrase. Use brackets [ ] if you need to replace a word or phrase.</li>
                <li>Make sure any omissions or changed words do not alter the meaning of the original text. Omit or replace words only when absolutely necessary to shorten the text or to make it grammatically correct within your sentence.</li>
                <li>Remember to include correctly formatted citations that follow the assigned style guide.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Primary and Secondary Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_p01">As you write your draft, be mindful of how you are using primary and secondary source material to support your points. Recall that primary sources present firsthand information. Secondary sources are one step removed from primary sources. They present a writer’s analysis or interpretation of primary source materials. How you balance primary and secondary source material in your paper will depend on the topic and assignment.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Using Primary Sources Effectively</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01_p01">Some types of research papers must use primary sources extensively to achieve their purpose. Any paper that analyzes a primary text or presents the writer’s own experimental research falls in this category. Here are a few examples:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>A paper for a literature course analyzing several poems by Emily Dickinson</li>
                <li>A paper for a political science course comparing televised speeches delivered by two presidential candidates</li>
                <li>A paper for a communications course discussing gender biases in television commercials</li>
                <li>A paper for a business administration course that discusses the results of a survey the writer conducted with local businesses to gather information about their work-from-home and flextime policies</li>
                <li>A paper for an elementary education course that discusses the results of an experiment the writer conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different methods of mathematics instruction</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01_p02">For these types of papers, primary research is the main focus. If you are writing about a work (including nonprint works, such as a movie or a painting), it is crucial to gather information and ideas from the original work, rather than relying solely on others’ interpretations. And, of course, if you take the time to design and conduct your own field research, such as a survey, a series of interviews, or an experiment, you will want to discuss it in detail. For example, the interviews may provide interesting responses that you want to share with your reader.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Using Secondary Sources Effectively</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p01">For some assignments, it makes sense to rely more on secondary sources than primary sources. If you are not analyzing a text or conducting your own field research, you will need to use secondary sources extensively.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p02">As much as possible, use secondary sources that are closely linked to primary research, such as a journal article presenting the results of the authors’ scientific study or a book that cites interviews and case studies. These sources are more reliable and add more value to your paper than sources that are further removed from primary research. For instance, a popular magazine article on junk-food addiction might be several steps removed from the original scientific study on which it is loosely based. As a result, the article may distort, sensationalize, or misinterpret the scientists’ findings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p03">Even if your paper is largely based on primary sources, you may use secondary sources to develop your ideas. For instance, an analysis of Alfred Hitchcock’s films would focus on the films themselves as a primary source, but might also cite commentary from critics. A paper that presents an original experiment would include some discussion of similar prior research in the field.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p04">Jorge knew he did not have the time, resources, or experience needed to conduct original experimental research for his paper. Because he was relying on secondary sources to support his ideas, he made a point of citing sources that were not far removed from primary research.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p05">Some sources could be considered primary or secondary sources, depending on the writer’s purpose for using them. For instance, if a writer’s purpose is to inform readers about how the No Child Left Behind legislation has affected elementary education, a <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine article on the subject would be a secondary source. However, suppose the writer’s purpose is to analyze how the news media has portrayed the effects of the No Child Left Behind legislation. In that case, articles about the legislation in news magazines like <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, and <em class="emphasis">US News &amp; World Report</em> would be primary sources. They provide firsthand examples of the media coverage the writer is analyzing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Avoiding Plagiarism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_p01">Your research paper presents your thinking about a topic, supported and developed by other people’s ideas and information. It is crucial to always distinguish between the two—as you conduct research, as you plan your paper, and as you write. Failure to do so can lead to plagiarism.</p>

Plagiarism may be deliberate or may occur unintentionally through careless use of source material.</span></span> is the act of misrepresenting someone else’s work as your own. Sometimes a writer plagiarizes work on purpose—for instance, by purchasing an essay from a website and submitting it as original course work. In other cases, a writer may commit accidental plagiarism due to carelessness, haste, or misunderstanding. To avoid unintentional plagiarism, follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_l01">
                <li>Understand what types of information must be cited.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s01_p01">Any idea or fact taken from an outside source must be cited, in both the body of your paper and the references list. The only exceptions are facts or general statements that are common knowledge. Common-knowledge facts or general statements are commonly supported by and found in multiple sources. For example, a writer would not need to cite the statement that most breads, pastas, and cereals are high in carbohydrates; this is well known and well documented. However, if a writer explained in detail the differences among the chemical structures of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, a citation would be necessary. When in doubt, cite.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p01">In recent years, issues related to the fair use of sources have been prevalent in popular culture. Recording artists, for example, may disagree about the extent to which one has the right to sample another’s music. For academic purposes, however, the guidelines for fair use are reasonably straightforward.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p02">Writers may quote from or paraphrase material from previously published works without formally obtaining the copyright holder’s permission. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Fair use</a><span class="glossdef">A legitimate use of brief quotations from source material to support and develop a writer’s ideas.</span></span> means that the writer legitimately uses brief excerpts from source material to support and develop his or her own ideas. For instance, a columnist may excerpt a few sentences from a novel when writing a book review. However, quoting or paraphrasing another’s work at excessive length, to the extent that large sections of the writing are unoriginal, is not fair use.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p03">As he worked on his draft, Jorge was careful to cite his sources correctly and not to rely excessively on any one source. Occasionally, however, he caught himself quoting a source at great length. In those instances, he highlighted the paragraph in question so that he could go back to it later and revise. Read the example, along with Jorge’s revision.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p04">Heinz (2009) found that “subjects in the low-carbohydrate group (30% carbohydrates; 40% protein, 30% fat) had a mean weight loss of 10 kg (22 lbs) over a 4-month period.” These results were “noticeably better than results for subjects on a low-fat diet (45% carbohydrates, 35% protein, 20% fat)” whose average weight loss was only “7 kg (15.4 lbs) in the same period.” From this, it can be concluded that “low-carbohydrate diets obtain more rapid results.” Other researchers agree that “at least in the short term, patients following low-carbohydrate diets enjoy greater success” than those who follow alternative plans (Johnson &amp; Crowe, 2010).</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p05">After reviewing the paragraph, Jorge realized that he had drifted into unoriginal writing.

In a study comparing low-carbohydrate diets and low-fat diets, Heinz (2009) found that subjects who followed a low-carbohydrate plan (30% of total calories) for 4 months lost, on average, about 3 kilograms more than subjects who followed a low-fat diet for the same time. Heinz concluded that these plans yield quick results, an idea supported by a similar study conducted by Johnson and Crowe (2010). What remains to be seen, however, is whether this initial success can be sustained for longer periods.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p07">As Jorge revised the paragraph, he realized he did not need to quote these sources directly. Instead, he paraphrased their most important findings. He also made sure to include a topic sentence stating the main idea of the paragraph and a concluding sentence that transitioned to the next major topic in his essay.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s03_p01">Disorganization and carelessness sometimes lead to plagiarism. For instance, a writer may be unable to provide a complete, accurate citation if he didn’t record bibliographical information. A writer may cut and paste a passage from a website into her paper and later forget where the material came from. A writer who procrastinates may rush through a draft, which easily leads to sloppy paraphrasing and inaccurate quotations. Any of these actions can create the appearance of plagiarism and lead to negative consequences.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s03_p02">Carefully organizing your time and notes is the best guard against these forms of plagiarism. Maintain a detailed working bibliography and thorough notes throughout the research process. Check original sources again to clear up any uncertainties. Allow plenty of time for writing your draft so there is no temptation to cut corners.</p>

If you need to consult outside sources to research a document you are creating, follow the general guidelines already discussed, as well as any industry-specific citation guidelines.

Even when cheating and plagiarism go undetected, they still result in a student’s failure to learn necessary research and writing skills.
