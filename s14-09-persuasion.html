        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s01_p01">The purpose of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">persuasion</a><span class="glossdef">The attempt to convince or move others to a certain point of view, or opinion.</span></span> in writing is to convince, motivate, or move readers toward a certain point of view, or opinion. The act of trying to persuade automatically implies more than one opinion on the subject can be argued.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s01_p02">The idea of an argument often conjures up images of two people yelling and screaming in anger. In writing, however, an argument is very different. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">argument</a><span class="glossdef">A reasoned opinion supported and explained by evidence.</span></span> is a reasoned opinion supported and explained by evidence. To argue in writing is to advance knowledge and ideas in a positive way. Written arguments often fail when they employ ranting rather than reasoning.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s01_p03">Most of us feel inclined to try to win the arguments we engage in. On some level, we all want to be right, and we want others to see the error of their ways. More times than not, however, arguments in which both sides try to win end up producing losers all around. The more productive approach is to persuade your audience to consider your opinion as a valid one, not simply the right one.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s01_p01">The persuasive essay begins with an engaging introduction that presents the general topic. The thesis typically appears somewhere in the introduction and states the writer’s point of view.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s01_p02">Avoid forming a thesis based on a negative claim. For example, “The hourly minimum wage is not high enough for the average worker to live on.” This is probably a true statement, but persuasive arguments should make a positive case. That is, the thesis statement should focus on how the hourly minimum wage is low or insufficient.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Acknowledging Opposing Ideas and Limits to Your Argument</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p01">Because an argument implies differing points of view on the subject, you must be sure to acknowledge those opposing ideas. Avoiding ideas that conflict with your own gives the reader the impression that you may be uncertain, fearful, or unaware of opposing ideas. Thus it is essential that you not only address counterarguments but also do so respectfully.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p02">Try to address opposing arguments earlier rather than later in your essay. Rhetorically speaking, ordering your positive arguments last allows you to better address ideas that conflict with your own, so you can spend the rest of the essay countering those arguments. This way, you leave your reader thinking about your argument rather than someone else’s. You have the last word.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p03">Acknowledging points of view different from your own also has the effect of fostering more credibility between you and the audience. They know from the outset that you are aware of opposing ideas and that you are not afraid to give them space.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p04">It is also helpful to establish the limits of your argument and what you are trying to accomplish. In effect, you are conceding early on that your argument is not the ultimate authority on a given topic. Such humility can go a long way toward earning credibility and trust with an audience. Audience members will know from the beginning that you are a reasonable writer, and audience members will trust your argument as a result. For example, in the following concessionary statement, the writer advocates for stricter gun control laws, but she admits it will not solve all of our problems with crime:</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_n01">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p05">Although tougher gun control laws are a powerful first step in decreasing violence in our streets, such legislation alone cannot end these problems since guns are not the only problem we face.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_p06">Such a concession will be welcome by those who might disagree with this writer’s argument in the first place. To effectively persuade their readers, writers need to be modest in their goals and humble in their approach to get readers to listen to the ideas. See <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch10_s09_s02_s02_t01">Table 10.5 "Phrases of Concession"</a> for some useful phrases of concession.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Bias in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p01">Everyone has various biases on any number of topics. For example, you might have a bias toward wearing black instead of brightly colored clothes or wearing jeans rather than formal wear. You might have a bias toward working at night rather than in the morning, or working by deadlines rather than getting tasks done in advance. These examples identify minor biases, of course, but they still indicate preferences and opinions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p02">Handling bias in writing and in daily life can be a useful skill. It will allow you to articulate your own points of view while also defending yourself against unreasonable points of view. The ideal in persuasive writing is to let your reader know your bias, but do not let that bias blind you to the primary components of good argumentation: sound, thoughtful evidence and a respectful and reasonable address of opposing sides.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p03">The strength of a personal bias is that it can motivate you to construct a strong argument. If you are invested in the topic, you are more likely to care about the piece of writing. Similarly, the more you care, the more time and effort you are apt to put forth and the better the final product will be.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_p04">The weakness of bias is when the bias begins to take over the essay—when, for example, you neglect opposing ideas, exaggerate your points, or repeatedly insert yourself ahead of the subject by using <em class="emphasis">I</em> too often. Being aware of all three of these pitfalls will help you avoid them.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">The Use of <em class="emphasis bolditalic">I</em> in Writing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_p01">The use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> in writing is often a topic of debate, and the acceptance of its usage varies from instructor to instructor. It is difficult to predict the preferences for all your present and future instructors, but consider the effects it can potentially have on your writing.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_p02">Be mindful of the use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> in your writing because it can make your argument sound overly biased. There are two primary reasons:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_l01">
                <li>Excessive repetition of any word will eventually catch the reader’s attention—and usually not in a good way. The use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> is no different.</li>
                <li>The insertion of <em class="emphasis">I</em> into a sentence alters not only the way a sentence might sound but also the composition of the sentence itself. <em class="emphasis">I</em> is often the subject of a sentence. If the subject of the essay is supposed to be, say, smoking, then by inserting yourself into the sentence, you are effectively displacing the subject of the essay into a secondary position. In the following example, the subject of the sentence is underlined:</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_n01">

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s03_s01_p05">In the first sentence, the rightful subject, <em class="emphasis">smoking</em>, is in the subject position in the sentence. In the second sentence, the insertion of <em class="emphasis">I</em> and <em class="emphasis">think</em> replaces <em class="emphasis">smoking</em> as the subject, which draws attention to <em class="emphasis">I</em> and away from the topic that is supposed to be discussed. Remember to keep the message (the subject) and the messenger (the writer) separate.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s05_p01">Adding visual elements to a persuasive argument can often strengthen its persuasive effect. There are two main types of visual elements: quantitative visuals and qualitative visuals.</p>

The purpose of using quantitative visuals is to make logical appeals to the audience. For example, sometimes it is easier to understand the disparity in certain statistics if you can see how the disparity looks graphically. Bar graphs, pie charts, Venn diagrams, histograms, and line graphs are all ways of presenting quantitative data in spatial dimensions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s05_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Qualitative visuals</a><span class="glossdef">Visuals present images that are to appeal to the audience’s emotions.</span></span> present images that appeal to the audience’s emotions. Photographs and pictorial images are examples of qualitative visuals. Such images often try to convey a story, and seeing an actual example can carry more power than hearing or reading about the example. For example, one image of a child suffering from malnutrition will likely have more of an emotional impact than pages dedicated to describing that same condition in writing.</p>

Providing visual elements for your audience can be an effective timesaving tool. Quantitative visuals in business presentations serve the same purpose as they do in persuasive writing. They should make logical appeals by showing numerical data in a spatial design. Quantitative visuals should be pictures that might appeal to your audience’s emotions. You will find that many of the rhetorical devices used in writing are the same ones used in the workplace.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p01">Choose a topic that you feel passionate about. If your instructor requires you to write about a specific topic, approach the subject from an angle that interests you. Begin your essay with an engaging introduction. Your thesis should typically appear somewhere in your introduction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p02">Start by acknowledging and explaining points of view that may conflict with your own to build credibility and trust with your audience. Also state the limits of your argument. This too helps you sound more reasonable and honest to those who may naturally be inclined to disagree with your view. By respectfully acknowledging opposing arguments and conceding limitations to your own view, you set a measured and responsible tone for the essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p03">Make your appeals in support of your thesis by using sound, credible evidence. Use a balance of facts and opinions from a wide range of sources, such as scientific studies, expert testimony, statistics, and personal anecdotes. Each piece of evidence should be fully explained and clearly stated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_p04">Make sure that your style and tone are appropriate for your subject and audience. Tailor your language and word choice to these two factors, while still being true to your own voice.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch10_s09_s06_l01">
                <li>The purpose of persuasion in writing is to convince or move readers toward a certain point of view, or opinion.</li>
                <li>An argument is a reasoned opinion supported and explained by evidence. To argue, in writing, is to advance knowledge and ideas in a positive way.</li>
                <li>A thesis that expresses the opinion of the writer in more specific terms is better than one that is vague.</li>
                <li>It is essential that you not only address counterarguments but also do so respectfully.</li>
                <li>It is also helpful to establish the limits of your argument and what you are trying to accomplish through a concession statement.</li>
                <li>To persuade a skeptical audience, you will need to use a wide range of evidence. Scientific studies, opinions from experts, historical precedent, statistics, personal anecdotes, and current events are all types of evidence that you might use in explaining your point.</li>
                <li>Make sure that your word choice and writing style is appropriate for both your subject and your audience.</li>
                <li>You should let your reader know your bias, but do not let that bias blind you to the primary components of good argumentation: sound, thoughtful evidence and respectfully and reasonably addressing opposing ideas.</li>
                <li>You should be mindful of the use of <em class="emphasis">I</em> in your writing because it can make your argument sound more biased than it needs to.</li>
                <li>Facts are statements that can be proven using objective data.</li>
                <li>Opinions are personal views, or judgments, that cannot be proven.</li>
                <li>In writing, you want to strike a balance between credible facts and authoritative opinions.</li>
                <li>Quantitative visuals present data graphically. The purpose of using quantitative visuals is to make logical appeals to the audience.</li>
                <li>Qualitative visuals present images that appeal to the audience’s emotions.</li>
            </ul>
