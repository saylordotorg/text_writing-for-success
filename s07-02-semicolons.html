    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_p01">Another punctuation mark that you will encounter is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">semicolon (;)</a><span class="glossdef">A punctuation mark that indicates a pause and joins two independent clauses or separates a list when the list already requires commas.</span></span>. Like most punctuation marks, the semicolon can be used in a variety of ways. The semicolon indicates a break in the flow of a sentence, but functions differently than a period or a comma. When you encounter a semicolon while reading aloud, this represents a good place to pause and take a breath.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Semicolons to Join Two Independent Clauses</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s01_p01">Use a semicolon to combine two closely related independent clauses. Relying on a period to separate the related clauses into two shorter sentences could lead to choppy writing. Using a comma would create an awkward run-on sentence.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Correct:</strong> Be sure to wear clean, well-pressed clothes to the interview<strong class="emphasis bold">;</strong> appearances are important.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Choppy:</strong> Be sure to wear clean, well-pressed clothes to the interview<strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> Appearances are important.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Incorrect:</strong> Be sure to wear clean, well-pressed clothes to the interview<strong class="emphasis bold">,</strong> appearances are important.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s01_p05">In this case, writing the independent clauses as two sentences separated by a period is correct. However, using a semicolon to combine the clauses can make your writing more interesting by creating a variety of sentence lengths and structures while preserving the flow of ideas.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Semicolons to Join Items in a List</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s02_p01">You can also use a semicolon to join items in a list when the items in the list already require commas. Semicolons help the reader distinguish between items in the list.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s02_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Correct:</strong> The color combinations we can choose from are black, white, and grey<strong class="emphasis bold">;</strong> green, brown, and black<strong class="emphasis bold">;</strong> or red, green, and brown.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s02_p04">By using semicolons in this sentence, the reader can easily distinguish between the three sets of colors.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s02_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch03_s02_s02_p05">Use semicolons to join two main clauses. Do not use semicolons with coordinating conjunctions such as <em class="emphasis">and</em>, <em class="emphasis">or</em>, and <em class="emphasis">but</em>.</p>
