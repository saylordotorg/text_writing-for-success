    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_p01">At last, you are ready to begin writing the rough draft of your research paper. Putting your thinking and research into words is exciting. It can also be challenging. In this section, you will learn strategies for handling the more challenging aspects of writing a research paper, such as integrating material from your sources, citing information correctly, and avoiding any misuse of your sources.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Structure of a Research Paper</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_p01">Research papers generally follow the same basic structure: an introduction that presents the writer’s thesis, a body section that develops the thesis with supporting points and evidence, and a conclusion that revisits the thesis and provides additional insights or suggestions for further research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Your writing voice will come across most strongly in your introduction and conclusion, as you work to attract your readers’ interest and establish your thesis. These sections usually do not cite sources at length. They focus on the big picture, not specific details. In contrast, the body of your paper will cite sources extensively. As you present your ideas, you will support your points with details from your research.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Writing Your Introduction</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p01">There are several approaches to writing an introduction, each of which fulfills the same goals. The introduction should get readers’ attention, provide background information, and present the writer’s thesis. Many writers like to begin with one of the following catchy openers:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>A surprising fact</li>
                <li>A thought-provoking question</li>
                <li>An attention-getting quote</li>
                <li>A brief anecdote that illustrates a larger concept</li>
                <li>A connection between your topic and your readers’ experiences</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p02">The next few sentences place the opening in context by presenting background information. From there, the writer builds toward a thesis, which is traditionally placed at the end of the introduction. Think of your thesis as a signpost that lets readers know in what direction the paper is headed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p03">Jorge decided to begin his research paper by connecting his topic to readers’ daily experiences. Read the first draft of his introduction. The thesis is underlined. Note how Jorge progresses from the opening sentences to background information to his thesis.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p04">I. Introduction</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p05">Over the past decade, increasing numbers of Americans have jumped on the low-carb bandwagon. Some studies estimate that approximately 40 million Americans, or about 20 percent of the population, are attempting to restrict their intake of food high in carbohydrates (Sanders and Katz, 2004; Hirsch, 2004). Proponents of low-carb diets say they are not only the most effective way to lose weight, but they also yield health benefits such as lower blood pressure and improved cholesterol levels. Meanwhile, some doctors claim that low-carb diets are overrated and caution that their long-term effects are unknown. <span class="token">Although following a low-carbohydrate diet can benefit some people, these diets are not necessarily the best option for everyone who wants to lose weight or improve their health.</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p07">Writers often work out of sequence when writing a research paper. If you find yourself struggling to write an engaging introduction, you may wish to write the body of your paper first. Writing the body sections first will help you clarify your main points. Writing the introduction should then be easier. You may have a better sense of how to introduce the paper after you have drafted some or all of the body.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Writing Your Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p01">In your introduction, you tell readers where they are headed. In your conclusion, you recap where they have been. For this reason, some writers prefer to write their conclusions soon after they have written their introduction. However, this method may not work for all writers. Other writers prefer to write their conclusion at the end of the paper, after writing the body paragraphs. No process is absolutely right or absolutely wrong; find the one that best suits you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p02">No matter when you compose the conclusion, it should sum up your main ideas and revisit your thesis. The conclusion should not simply echo the introduction or rely on bland summary statements, such as “In this paper, I have demonstrated that.…” In fact, avoid repeating your thesis verbatim from the introduction. Restate it in different words that reflect the new perspective gained through your research. That helps keep your ideas fresh for your readers. An effective writer might conclude a paper by asking a new question the research inspired, revisiting an anecdote presented earlier, or reminding readers of how the topic relates to their lives.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p03">If your job involves writing or reading scientific papers, it helps to understand how professional researchers use the structure described in this section. A scientific paper begins with an abstract that briefly summarizes the entire paper. The introduction explains the purpose of the research, briefly summarizes previous research, and presents the researchers’ hypothesis. The body provides details about the study, such as who participated in it, what the researchers measured, and what results they recorded. The conclusion presents the researchers’ interpretation of the data, or what they learned.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Source Material in Your Paper</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p01">One of the challenges of writing a research paper is successfully integrating your ideas with material from your sources. Your paper must explain what you think, or it will read like a disconnected string of facts and quotations. However, you also need to support your ideas with research, or they will seem insubstantial. How do you strike the right balance?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p02">You have already taken a step in the right direction by writing your introduction. The introduction and conclusion function like the frame around a picture. They define and limit your topic and place your research in context.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p03">In the body paragraphs of your paper, you will need to integrate ideas carefully at the paragraph level and at the sentence level. You will use topic sentences in your paragraphs to make sure readers understand the significance of any facts, details, or quotations you cite. You will also include sentences that transition between ideas from your research, either within a paragraph or between paragraphs. At the sentence level, you will need to think carefully about how you introduce paraphrased and quoted material.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_p04">Earlier you learned about summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting when taking notes. In the next few sections, you will learn how to use these techniques in the body of your paper to weave in source material to support your ideas.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Summarizing Sources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p01">When you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summarize</a><span class="glossdef">To concisely restate in one’s own words the main ideas from a source.</span></span> material from a source, you zero in on the main points and restate them concisely in your own words. This technique is appropriate when only the major ideas are relevant to your paper or when you need to simplify complex information into a few key points for your readers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p02">Be sure to review the source material as you summarize it. Identify the main idea and restate it as concisely as you can—preferably in one sentence. Depending on your purpose, you may also add another sentence or two condensing any important details or examples. Check your summary to make sure it is accurate and complete.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p03">In his draft, Jorge summarized research materials that presented scientists’ findings about low-carbohydrate diets. Read the following passage from a trade magazine article and Jorge’s summary of the article.</p>

                <p class="simpara">Adrienne Howell, Ph.D.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p04">Over the past few years, a number of clinical studies have explored whether high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are more effective for weight loss than other frequently recommended diet plans, such as diets that drastically curtail fat intake (Pritikin) or that emphasize consuming lean meats, grains, vegetables, and a moderate amount of unsaturated fats (the Mediterranean diet). A 2009 study found that obese teenagers who followed a low-carbohydrate diet lost an average of 15.6 kilograms over a six-month period, whereas teenagers following a low-fat diet or a Mediterranean diet lost an average of 11.1 kilograms and 9.3 kilograms respectively. Two 2010 studies that measured weight loss for obese adults following these same three diet plans found similar results. Over three months, subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet plan lost anywhere from four to six kilograms more than subjects who followed other diet plans.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p05">In three recent studies, researchers compared outcomes for obese subjects who followed either a low-carbohydrate diet, a low-fat diet, or a Mediterranean diet and found that subjects following a low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight in the same time (Howell, 2010).</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p06">A summary restates ideas in your own words—but for specialized or clinical terms, you may need to use terms that appear in the original source. For instance, Jorge used the term <em class="emphasis">obese</em> in his summary because related words such as <em class="emphasis">heavy</em> or <em class="emphasis">overweight</em> have a different clinical meaning.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p07">On a separate sheet of paper, practice summarizing by writing a one-sentence summary of the same passage that Jorge already summarized.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Paraphrasing Sources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p01">When you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paraphrase</a><span class="glossdef">To restate ideas or information from sources using one’s own words and sentence structures.</span></span> material from a source, restate the information from an entire sentence or passage in your own words, using your own original sentence structure. A paraphrased source differs from a summarized source in that you focus on restating the ideas, not condensing them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p02">Again, it is important to check your paraphrase against the source material to make sure it is both accurate and original. Inexperienced writers sometimes use the thesaurus method of paraphrasing—that is, they simply rewrite the source material, replacing most of the words with synonyms. This constitutes a misuse of sources. A true paraphrase restates ideas using the writer’s own language and style.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p03">In his draft, Jorge frequently paraphrased details from sources. At times, he needed to rewrite a sentence more than once to ensure he was paraphrasing ideas correctly. Read the passage from a website. Then read Jorge’s initial attempt at paraphrasing it, followed by the final version of his paraphrase.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s02_n01">

            <h2 class="title editable block">Quoting Sources Directly</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p01">Most of the time, you will summarize or paraphrase source material instead of quoting directly. Doing so shows that you understand your research well enough to write about it confidently in your own words. However, direct quotes can be powerful when used sparingly and with purpose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p02">Quoting directly can sometimes help you make a point in a colorful way. If an author’s words are especially vivid, memorable, or well phrased, quoting them may help hold your reader’s interest. Direct quotations from an interviewee or an eyewitness may help you personalize an issue for readers. And when you analyze primary sources, such as a historical speech or a work of literature, quoting extensively is often necessary to illustrate your points. These are valid reasons to use quotations.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p03">Less experienced writers, however, sometimes overuse direct quotations in a research paper because it seems easier than paraphrasing. At best, this reduces the effectiveness of the quotations. At worst, it results in a paper that seems haphazardly pasted together from outside sources. Use quotations sparingly for greater impact.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p04">When you do choose to quote directly from a source, follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s02_s03_l01">
                <li>Make sure you have transcribed the original statement accurately.</li>
                <li>Represent the author’s ideas honestly. Quote enough of the original text to reflect the author’s point accurately.</li>
                <li>Never use a stand-alone quotation. Always integrate the quoted material into your own sentence.</li>
                <li>Use ellipses (…) if you need to omit a word or phrase. Use brackets [ ] if you need to replace a word or phrase.</li>
                <li>Make sure any omissions or changed words do not alter the meaning of the original text. Omit or replace words only when absolutely necessary to shorten the text or to make it grammatically correct within your sentence.</li>
                <li>Remember to include correctly formatted citations that follow the assigned style guide.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Primary and Secondary Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_p01">As you write your draft, be mindful of how you are using primary and secondary source material to support your points. Recall that primary sources present firsthand information. Secondary sources are one step removed from primary sources. They present a writer’s analysis or interpretation of primary source materials. How you balance primary and secondary source material in your paper will depend on the topic and assignment.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Using Primary Sources Effectively</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01_p01">Some types of research papers must use primary sources extensively to achieve their purpose. Any paper that analyzes a primary text or presents the writer’s own experimental research falls in this category. Here are a few examples:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01_l01">
                <li>A paper for a literature course analyzing several poems by Emily Dickinson</li>
                <li>A paper for a political science course comparing televised speeches delivered by two presidential candidates</li>
                <li>A paper for a communications course discussing gender biases in television commercials</li>
                <li>A paper for a business administration course that discusses the results of a survey the writer conducted with local businesses to gather information about their work-from-home and flextime policies</li>
                <li>A paper for an elementary education course that discusses the results of an experiment the writer conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different methods of mathematics instruction</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s01_p02">For these types of papers, primary research is the main focus. If you are writing about a work (including nonprint works, such as a movie or a painting), it is crucial to gather information and ideas from the original work, rather than relying solely on others’ interpretations. And, of course, if you take the time to design and conduct your own field research, such as a survey, a series of interviews, or an experiment, you will want to discuss it in detail. For example, the interviews may provide interesting responses that you want to share with your reader.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Using Secondary Sources Effectively</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p01">For some assignments, it makes sense to rely more on secondary sources than primary sources. If you are not analyzing a text or conducting your own field research, you will need to use secondary sources extensively.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p02">As much as possible, use secondary sources that are closely linked to primary research, such as a journal article presenting the results of the authors’ scientific study or a book that cites interviews and case studies. These sources are more reliable and add more value to your paper than sources that are further removed from primary research. For instance, a popular magazine article on junk-food addiction might be several steps removed from the original scientific study on which it is loosely based. As a result, the article may distort, sensationalize, or misinterpret the scientists’ findings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p03">Even if your paper is largely based on primary sources, you may use secondary sources to develop your ideas. For instance, an analysis of Alfred Hitchcock’s films would focus on the films themselves as a primary source, but might also cite commentary from critics. A paper that presents an original experiment would include some discussion of similar prior research in the field.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p04">Jorge knew he did not have the time, resources, or experience needed to conduct original experimental research for his paper. Because he was relying on secondary sources to support his ideas, he made a point of citing sources that were not far removed from primary research.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_n01">
                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p05">Some sources could be considered primary or secondary sources, depending on the writer’s purpose for using them. For instance, if a writer’s purpose is to inform readers about how the No Child Left Behind legislation has affected elementary education, a <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine article on the subject would be a secondary source. However, suppose the writer’s purpose is to analyze how the news media has portrayed the effects of the No Child Left Behind legislation. In that case, articles about the legislation in news magazines like <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, and <em class="emphasis">US News &amp; World Report</em> would be primary sources. They provide firsthand examples of the media coverage the writer is analyzing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Avoiding Plagiarism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_p01">Your research paper presents your thinking about a topic, supported and developed by other people’s ideas and information. It is crucial to always distinguish between the two—as you conduct research, as you plan your paper, and as you write. Failure to do so can lead to plagiarism.</p>

Plagiarism may be deliberate or may occur unintentionally through careless use of source material.</span></span> is the act of misrepresenting someone else’s work as your own. Sometimes a writer plagiarizes work on purpose—for instance, by purchasing an essay from a website and submitting it as original course work. In other cases, a writer may commit accidental plagiarism due to carelessness, haste, or misunderstanding. To avoid unintentional plagiarism, follow these guidelines:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_l01">
                <li>Understand what types of information must be cited.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s01_p01">Any idea or fact taken from an outside source must be cited, in both the body of your paper and the references list. The only exceptions are facts or general statements that are common knowledge. Common-knowledge facts or general statements are commonly supported by and found in multiple sources. For example, a writer would not need to cite the statement that most breads, pastas, and cereals are high in carbohydrates; this is well known and well documented. However, if a writer explained in detail the differences among the chemical structures of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, a citation would be necessary. When in doubt, cite.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p01">In recent years, issues related to the fair use of sources have been prevalent in popular culture. Recording artists, for example, may disagree about the extent to which one has the right to sample another’s music. For academic purposes, however, the guidelines for fair use are reasonably straightforward.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p02">Writers may quote from or paraphrase material from previously published works without formally obtaining the copyright holder’s permission. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Fair use</a><span class="glossdef">A legitimate use of brief quotations from source material to support and develop a writer’s ideas.</span></span> means that the writer legitimately uses brief excerpts from source material to support and develop his or her own ideas. For instance, a columnist may excerpt a few sentences from a novel when writing a book review. However, quoting or paraphrasing another’s work at excessive length, to the extent that large sections of the writing are unoriginal, is not fair use.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p03">As he worked on his draft, Jorge was careful to cite his sources correctly and not to rely excessively on any one source. Occasionally, however, he caught himself quoting a source at great length. In those instances, he highlighted the paragraph in question so that he could go back to it later and revise. Read the example, along with Jorge’s revision.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p04">Heinz (2009) found that “subjects in the low-carbohydrate group (30% carbohydrates; 40% protein, 30% fat) had a mean weight loss of 10 kg (22 lbs) over a 4-month period.” These results were “noticeably better than results for subjects on a low-fat diet (45% carbohydrates, 35% protein, 20% fat)” whose average weight loss was only “7 kg (15.4 lbs) in the same period.” From this, it can be concluded that “low-carbohydrate diets obtain more rapid results.” Other researchers agree that “at least in the short term, patients following low-carbohydrate diets enjoy greater success” than those who follow alternative plans (Johnson &amp; Crowe, 2010).</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p05">After reviewing the paragraph, Jorge realized that he had drifted into unoriginal writing.

In a study comparing low-carbohydrate diets and low-fat diets, Heinz (2009) found that subjects who followed a low-carbohydrate plan (30% of total calories) for 4 months lost, on average, about 3 kilograms more than subjects who followed a low-fat diet for the same time. Heinz concluded that these plans yield quick results, an idea supported by a similar study conducted by Johnson and Crowe (2010). What remains to be seen, however, is whether this initial success can be sustained for longer periods.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s02_p07">As Jorge revised the paragraph, he realized he did not need to quote these sources directly.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s03_p01">Disorganization and carelessness sometimes lead to plagiarism. For instance, a writer may be unable to provide a complete, accurate citation if he didn’t record bibliographical information. A writer may cut and paste a passage from a website into her paper and later forget where the material came from. A writer who procrastinates may rush through a draft, which easily leads to sloppy paraphrasing and inaccurate quotations. Any of these actions can create the appearance of plagiarism and lead to negative consequences.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s01_s05_s01_s03_p02">Carefully organizing your time and notes is the best guard against these forms of plagiarism. Maintain a detailed working bibliography and thorough notes throughout the research process. Check original sources again to clear up any uncertainties. Allow plenty of time for writing your draft so there is no temptation to cut corners.</p>

If you need to consult outside sources to research a document you are creating, follow the general guidelines already discussed, as well as any industry-specific citation guidelines.

As he read, he highlighted the main idea of each paragraph so he could see whether his ideas proceeded in a logical order. For the most part, the flow of ideas was clear. However, he did notice that one paragraph did not have a clear main idea. It interrupted the flow of the writing. During revision, Jorge added a topic sentence that clearly connected the paragraph to the one that had preceded it. He also added transitions to improve the flow of ideas from sentence to sentence.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p01">When you revise to improve cohesion, you analyze how the parts of your paper work together. You look for anything that seems awkward or out of place. Revision may involve deleting unnecessary material or rewriting parts of the paper so that the out-of-place material fits in smoothly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p02">In a research paper, problems with cohesion usually occur when a writer has trouble integrating source material. If facts or quotations have been awkwardly dropped into a paragraph, they distract or confuse the reader instead of working to support the writer’s point. Overusing paraphrased and quoted material has the same effect. Use Checklist 12.2 to review your essay for cohesion.</p>

Speakers sometimes rely on cute graphics or funny quotations to hold their audience’s attention. If you choose to use these elements, make sure they work well with the substantive content of your presentation. For example, if you are asked to give a financial presentation, and the financial report shows that the company lost money, funny illustrations would not be relevant or appropriate for the presentation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using a Consistent Style and Tone</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Once you are certain that the content of your paper fulfills your purpose, you can begin revising to improve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">style</a><span class="glossdef">The unique way a writer uses language, which encompasses choices about sentence structure and word selection.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tone</a><span class="glossdef">In writing, the attitude a writer conveys toward the subject and the audience.</span></span>. Together, your style and tone create the voice of your paper, or how you come across to readers. Style refers to the way you use language as a writer—the sentence structures you use and the word choices you make. Tone is the attitude toward your subject and audience that you convey through your word choice.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Determining an Appropriate Style and Tone</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01_p01">Although accepted writing styles will vary within different disciplines, the underlying goal is the same—to come across to your readers as a knowledgeable, authoritative guide. Writing about research is like being a tour guide who walks readers through a topic. A stuffy, overly formal tour guide can make readers feel put off or intimidated. Too much informality or humor can make readers wonder whether the tour guide really knows what he or she is talking about. Extreme or emotionally charged language comes across as unbalanced.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01_p02">To help prevent being overly formal or informal, determine an appropriate style and tone at the beginning of the research process. Consider your topic and audience because these can help dictate style and tone. For example, a paper on new breakthroughs in cancer research should be more formal than a paper on ways to get a good night’s sleep.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01_p03">A strong research paper comes across as straightforward, appropriately academic, and serious. It is generally best to avoid writing in the first person, as this can make your paper seem overly subjective and opinion based. Use Checklist 12.3 on style to review your paper for other issues that affect style and tone. You can check for consistency at the end of the writing process. Checking for consistency is discussed later in this section.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s02_p01">As you revise your paper, make sure your style is consistent throughout. Look for instances where a word, phrase, or sentence just does not seem to fit with the rest of the writing. It is best to reread for style after you have completed the other revisions so that you are not distracted by any larger content issues. Revising strategies you can use include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Share your paper with another reader whom you trust to give you honest feedback.</strong> It is often difficult to evaluate one’s own style objectively—especially in the final phase of a challenging writing project. Another reader may be more likely to notice instances of wordiness, confusing language, or other issues that affect style and tone.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Line-edit your paper slowly, sentence by sentence.</strong> You may even wish to use a sheet of paper to cover everything on the page except the paragraph you are editing—that forces you to read slowly and carefully.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p01">Given how much work you have put into your research paper, you will want to check for any errors that could distract or confuse your readers. Using the spell-checking feature in your word-processing program can be helpful—but this should not replace a full, careful review of your document. Be sure to check for any errors that may have come up frequently for you in the past. Use Checklist 12.4 to help you as you edit:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s03_s02_p01">When editing a research paper, it is also important to check that you have cited sources properly and formatted your document according to the specified guidelines. There are two reasons for this. First and foremost, citing sources correctly ensures that you have given proper credit to other people for ideas and information that helped you in your work. Second, using correct formatting establishes your paper as one student’s contribution to the work developed by and for a larger academic community. Increasingly, American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines are the standard for many academic fields. Modern Language Association (MLA) is also a standard style in many fields. Use Checklist 12.5 to help you check citations and formatting.</p>

However, it is good practice for learning how to follow accepted conventions in any professional field. Many large corporations create a style manual with guidelines for editing and formatting documents produced by that corporation. Employees follow the style manual when creating internal documents and documents for publication.</p>

                    <li>In a cohesive research paper, the elements of the paper work together smoothly and naturally. When revising a research paper, evaluate its cohesion. In particular, check that information from research is smoothly integrated with your ideas.</li>
                    <li>An effective research paper uses a style and tone that are appropriately academic and serious. When revising a research paper, check that the style and tone are consistent throughout.</li>

            <li>In this chapter, you learned strategies for generating and narrowing a topic for a research paper. Brainstorm to create a list of five general topics of personal or professional interest to you that you would like to research. Then use freewriting and preliminary research to narrow three of these topics to manageable size for a five- to seven-page research paper. Save your list of topics in a print or electronic file and add to it periodically as you identify additional areas of interest. Use your topic list as a starting point the next time a research paper is assigned.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Working with one of the topics you just identified, use the research skills you learned in this chapter to locate three to five potentially useful print or electronic sources of information about the topic. Create a list that includes the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch12_s03_l02">
                    <li>One subject-specific periodicals database likely to include relevant articles on your topic</li>
                    <li>Two articles about your topic written for an educated general audience</li>
                    <li>At least one article about your topic written for an audience with specialized knowledge</li>

            <li>
                <p class="para">In real-life and work-related contexts, people consult a wide range of different information sources every day, without always making conscious judgments about whether the source is reliable and why. Identify one media source of information you use at least once a week—for instance, a website you visit regularly, or a newspaper or magazine to which you subscribe. Write two paragraphs explaining the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch12_s03_l03">
                    <li>What topics you learn about by reading or viewing this source</li>
                    <li>Whether you consider this source reliable and why</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s03_p01">In addressing the latter point, be sure to consider details that help you evaluate the source’s credibility and reputability, as well as the presence or absence of bias.</p>

                <p class="para">Different professional communities develop their own standards about the writing style people in that community use when creating documents to share with others. In some cases, these standards may apply to a very broad group of professionals—for example, researchers in many different social sciences use APA style in academic writing. MLA style is commonly used in the humanities, including English classes. In other cases, style guidelines are specific to a particular company or organization. Find a document, such as a newsletter or brochure, that was produced by an organization to which you belong. (Make sure it is a document you have permission to share.) Review the document and answer the following questions:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch12_s03_l04">
                    <li>What are the purpose, intended audience, and message of this document?</li>
                    <li>How does the writing style function to fulfill the purpose, appeal to a particular audience, and convey a message? Consider elements of style, such as word choice, the use of active or passive voice, sentence length, and sentence structure. If your document includes graphics, consider their effectiveness as well.</li>
                    <li>Are there any places where the style is inconsistent?</li>
                    <li>Is the writing style of this document effective for achieving the document’s purpose? Why or why not? If it is not effective, explain why.</li>
