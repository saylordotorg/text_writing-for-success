    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_p01">Have you ever ordered a dish in a restaurant and been not happy with its taste, even though it contained most of your favorite ingredients? Just as a meal might lack the finishing touches needed to spice it up, so too might a paragraph contain all the basic components but still lack the stylistic finesse required to engage a reader. Sometimes writers have a tendency to reuse the same sentence pattern throughout their writing. Like any repetitive task, reading text that contains too many sentences with the same length and structure can become monotonous and boring. Experienced writers mix it up by using an assortment of sentence patterns, rhythms, and lengths.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_p02">In this chapter, you will follow a student named Naomi who has written a draft of an essay but needs to refine her writing. This section discusses how to introduce sentence variety into writing, how to open sentences using a variety of techniques, and how to use different types of sentence structure when connecting ideas. You can use these techniques when revising a paper to bring life and rhythm to your work. They will also make reading your work more enjoyable.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Incorporating Sentence Variety</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p01">Experienced writers incorporate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sentence variety</a><span class="glossdef">Use of an assortment of sentence patterns, rhythms, and lengths to reduce repetition and emphasize important points in a text.</span></span> into their writing by varying sentence style and structure. Using a mixture of different sentence structures reduces repetition and adds emphasis to important points in the text. Read the following example:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p02">During my time in office I have achieved several goals. I have helped increase funding for local schools. I have reduced crime rates in the neighborhood. I have encouraged young people to get involved in their community. My competitor argues that she is the better choice in the upcoming election. I argue that it is ridiculous to fix something that isn’t broken. If you reelect me this year, I promise to continue to serve this community.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p03">In this extract from an election campaign, the writer uses short, simple sentences of a similar length and style. Writers often mistakenly believe that this technique makes the text more clear for the reader, but the result is a choppy, unsophisticated paragraph that does not grab the audience’s attention. Now read the revised paragraph with sentence variety:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p04">During my time in office, I have helped increase funding for local schools, reduced crime rates in the neighborhood, and encouraged young people to get involved in their community. Why fix what isn’t broken? If you reelect me this year, I will continue to achieve great things for this community. Don’t take a chance on an unknown contender; vote for the proven success.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p05">Notice how introducing a short rhetorical question among the longer sentences in the paragraph is an effective means of keeping the reader’s attention. In the revised version, the writer combines the choppy sentences at the beginning into one longer sentence, which adds rhythm and interest to the paragraph.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_p06">Effective writers often implement the “rule of three,” which is basically the thought that things that contain three elements are more memorable and more satisfying to readers than any other number. Try to use a series of three when providing examples, grouping adjectives, or generating a list.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Using Sentence Variety at the Beginning of Sentences</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p01">Read the following sentences and consider what they all have in common:</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_n01">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p02">John and Amanda will be analyzing this week’s financial report.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p03">The car screeched to a halt just a few inches away from the young boy.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p05">If you are having trouble figuring out why these sentences are similar, try underlining the subject in each. You will notice that the subject is positioned at the beginning of each sentence—<em class="emphasis">John and Amanda</em>, <em class="emphasis">the car</em>, <em class="emphasis">students</em>. Since the subject-verb-object pattern is the simplest sentence structure, many writers tend to overuse this technique, which can result in repetitive paragraphs with little sentence variety.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p07">This section examines several ways to introduce sentence variety at the beginning of sentences, using Naomi’s essay as an example.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Starting a Sentence with an Adverb</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">One technique you can use so as to avoid beginning a sentence with the subject is to use an adverb. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adverb</a><span class="glossdef">A word that describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb and often ends in <em class="emphasis">-ly</em>.</span></span> is a word that describes a verb, adjective, or other adverb and often ends in -<em class="emphasis">ly</em>. Examples of adverbs include <em class="emphasis">quickly</em>, <em class="emphasis">softly</em>, <em class="emphasis">quietly</em>, <em class="emphasis">angrily</em>, and <em class="emphasis">timidly</em>. Read the following sentences:</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_n01">
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">She slowly turned the corner and peered into the murky basement.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p03">Slowly, she turned the corner and peered into the murky basement.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p04">In the second sentence, the adverb <em class="emphasis">slowly</em> is placed at the beginning of the sentence. If you read the two sentences aloud, you will notice that moving the adverb changes the rhythm of the sentence and slightly alters its meaning. The second sentence emphasizes how the subject moves—slowly—creating a buildup of tension. This technique is effective in fictional writing.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p05">Note that an adverb used at the beginning of a sentence is usually followed by a comma. A comma indicates that the reader should pause briefly, which creates a useful rhetorical device. Read the following sentences aloud and consider the effect of pausing after the adverb:</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_n02">
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p06">Cautiously, he unlocked the kennel and waited for the dog’s reaction.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s01_p07">Solemnly, the policeman approached the mayor and placed him under arrest.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s01_s02_p27">The overuse of prepositional phrases often occurs when our thoughts are jumbled and we are unsure how concepts or ideas relate to one another. If you are preparing a report or a proposal, take the time to organize your thoughts in an outline before writing a rough draft. Read the draft aloud, either to yourself or to a colleague, and identify areas that are rambling or unclear. If you notice that a particular part of your report contains several sentences over twenty words, you should double check that particular section to make certain that it is coherent and does not contain unnecessary prepositional phrases. Reading aloud sometimes helps detect unclear and wordy sentences. You can also ask a colleague to paraphrase your main points to ensure that the meaning is clear.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s02_s04_p01">Another technique that writers use to combine sentences is to join them using a relative clause. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relative clause</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that contains a subject and a verb and describes a noun. A relative clause functions as an adjective in a sentence.</span></span> is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and describes a noun. Relative clauses function as adjectives by answering questions such as <em class="emphasis">which one?</em> or <em class="emphasis">what kind?</em> Relative clauses begin with a relative pronoun, such as <em class="emphasis">who</em>, <em class="emphasis">which</em>, <em class="emphasis">where</em>, <em class="emphasis">why</em>, or <em class="emphasis">when</em>. Read the following examples:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s02_s04_p04">To connect two sentences using a relative clause, substitute the subject of one of the sentences (<em class="emphasis">he</em>) for a relative pronoun (<em class="emphasis">who</em>). This gives you a relative clause (<em class="emphasis">who lives in Seattle</em>) that can be placed next to the noun it describes (<em class="emphasis">the managing director</em>). Make sure to keep the sentence you want to emphasize as the main clause. For example, reversing the main clause and subordinate clause in the preceding sentence emphasizes where the managing director lives, not the fact that he is visiting the company.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s01_s01_s02_s04_p08">To check the punctuation of relative clauses, assess whether or not the clause can be taken out of the sentence without changing its meaning. If the relative clause is not essential to the meaning of the sentence, it should be placed in commas. If the relative clause is essential to the meaning of the sentence, it does not require commas around it.</p>

To combine two sentences using an appositive, drop the subject and verb from the sentence that renames the noun and turn it into a phrase. Note that in the previous example, the appositive is positioned immediately after the noun it describes. An appositive may be placed anywhere in a sentence, but it must come directly before or after the noun to which it refers:</p>

Most sentences are declarative, but a carefully placed question, exclamation, or command can pique colleagues’ interest, even if the subject material is fairly dry. Imagine that you are writing a budget analysis. Beginning your report with a rhetorical question, such as “Where is our money going?” or “How can we increase sales?” encourages people to continue reading to find out the answers. Although they should be used sparingly in academic and professional writing, questions or commands are effective rhetorical devices.</p>
