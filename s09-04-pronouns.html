We use pronouns so we do not have to repeat words. For example, imagine writing the following sentence: Afrah put her scarf on because Afrah was cold. The sentence sounds a bit strange because <em class="emphasis">Afrah</em> is named twice; however, if you use a pronoun, the sentence will be shorter and less repetitive. You might rewrite the sentence to something similar to the following: Afrah put her scarf on because she was cold<em class="emphasis">. She</em> refers to Afrah, so you do not have to write the name twice.</p>
