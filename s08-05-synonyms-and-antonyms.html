    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_p01">As you work with your draft, you will want to pay particular attention to the words you have chosen. Do they express exactly what you are trying to convey? Can you choose better, more effective words? Familiarity with synonyms and antonyms can be helpful in answering these questions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Synonyms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Synonyms</a><span class="glossdef">Words that have the same, or almost the same, meaning as another word.</span></span> are words that have the same, or almost the same, meaning as another word. You can say an “easy task” or a “simple task” because <em class="emphasis">easy</em> and <em class="emphasis">simple</em> are synonyms. You can say Hong Kong is a “large city” or a “metropolis” because <em class="emphasis">city</em> and <em class="emphasis">metropolis</em> are synonyms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p02">However, it is important to remember that not all pairs of words in the English language are so easily interchangeable. The slight but important differences in meaning between synonyms can make a big difference in your writing. For example, the words <em class="emphasis">boring</em> and <em class="emphasis">insipid</em> may have similar meanings, but the subtle differences between the two will affect the message your writing conveys. The word <em class="emphasis">insipid</em> evokes a scholarly and perhaps more pretentious message than <em class="emphasis">boring</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p03">The English language is full of pairs of words that have subtle distinctions between them. All writers, professionals and beginners alike, face the challenge of choosing the most appropriate synonym to best convey their ideas. When you pay particular attention to synonyms in your writing, it comes across to your reader. The sentences become much more clear and rich in meaning.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p04">Any writing you do at work involves a careful choice of words. For example, if you are writing an e-mail to your employer regarding your earnings, you can use the word <em class="emphasis">pay</em>, <em class="emphasis">salary</em>, or hourly <em class="emphasis">wage</em>. There are also other synonyms to choose from. Just keep in mind that the word you choose will have an effect on the reader, so you want to choose wisely to get the desired effect.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p06">When most people think of the Renaissance, they might think of artists like Michelangelo, Raphael, or Leonardo da Vinci, but they often overlook one of the <span class="token">very important</span> figures of the Renaissance: Filippo Brunelleschi. Brunelleschi was born in Florence, Italy in 1377. He is considered the <span class="token">very best</span> architect and engineer of the Renaissance. His <span class="token">impressive</span> accomplishments are a testament to following one’s dreams, persevering in the face of obstacles, and realizing one’s vision.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s05_s01_p07">The most difficult undertaking of Brunelleschi’s career was the dome of Florence Cathedral, which took sixteen years to construct. A major blow to the progress of the construction happened in 1428. Brunelleschi had designed a special ship to carry the one hundred tons of marble needed for the dome. He felt this would be the <span class="token">most inexpensive</span> way to transport the marble, but the unthinkable happened. The ship <span class="token">went down to the bottom of the water</span>, taking all the marble with it to the bottom of the river. Brunelleschi was <span class="token">really sad</span>. Nevertheless, he did not give up. He held true to his vision of the completed dome. Filippo Brunelleschi completed construction of the dome of Florence Cathedral in 1446. His influence on artists and architects alike was felt strongly during his lifetime and can still be felt <span class="token">in this day and age</span>.</p>
