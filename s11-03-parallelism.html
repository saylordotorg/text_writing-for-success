    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_p01">Earlier in this chapter, we learned that increasing sentence variety adds interest to a piece of writing and makes the reading process more enjoyable for others. Using a mixture of sentence lengths and patterns throughout an essay is an important writing technique. However, it is equally important to avoid introducing variation within individual sentences. A strong sentence is composed of balanced parts that all have the same structure. In this section, we will examine how to create a balanced sentence structure by using <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">parallelism</a><span class="glossdef">Using the same grammatical structure to express equal ideas in a sentence. Parallelism may occur at the word, phrase, or clause level.</span></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Parallelism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p01">Parallelism is the use of similar structure in related words, clauses, or phrases. It creates a sense of rhythm and balance within a sentence. As readers, we often correct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">faulty parallelism</a><span class="glossdef">A failure to create grammatically parallel structures in a sentence.</span></span>—a lack of parallel structure—intuitively because an unbalanced sentence sounds awkward and poorly constructed. Read the following sentences aloud:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> Kelly had to iron, do the washing, and shopping before her parents arrived.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> Driving a car requires coordination, patience, and to have good eyesight.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> Ali prefers jeans to wearing a suit.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p05">All of these sentences contain faulty parallelism. Although they are factually correct, the construction is clunky and confusing. In the first example, three different verb forms are used. In the second and third examples, the writer begins each sentence by using a noun (<em class="emphasis">coordination</em>, <em class="emphasis">jeans</em>), but ends with a phrase (<em class="emphasis">to have good eyesight</em>, <em class="emphasis">wearing a suit</em>). Now read the same three sentences that have correct parallelism.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Correct parallelism:</strong> Kelly had to do the ironing, washing, and shopping before her parents arrived.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Correct parallelism:</strong> Driving a car requires coordination, patience, and good eyesight.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Correct parallelism:</strong> Ali prefers wearing jeans to wearing a suit.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p09">When these sentences are written using a parallel structure, they sound more aesthetically pleasing because they are balanced. Repetition of grammatical construction also minimizes the amount of work the reader has to do to decode the sentence. This enables the reader to focus on the main idea in the sentence and not on how the sentence is put together.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_n03">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_p10">A simple way to check for parallelism in your writing is to make sure you have paired nouns with nouns, verbs with verbs, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases, and so on. Underline each element in a sentence and check that the corresponding element uses the same grammatical form.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Creating Parallelism Using Coordinating Conjunctions</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p01">When you connect two clauses using a coordinating conjunction (<em class="emphasis">for</em>, <em class="emphasis">and</em>, <em class="emphasis">nor</em>, <em class="emphasis">but</em>, <em class="emphasis">or</em>, <em class="emphasis">yet</em>, <em class="emphasis">so</em>), make sure that the same grammatical structure is used on each side of the conjunction. Take a look at the following example:</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s01_n01">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> When I walk the dog, I like <strong class="emphasis bold">to listen to music</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">talking to friends</strong> on the phone.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p04">The first sentence uses two different verb forms (<em class="emphasis">to listen</em>, <em class="emphasis">talking</em>). In the second sentence, the grammatical construction on each side of the coordinating conjunction (<em class="emphasis">and</em>) is the same, creating a parallel sentence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p05">The same technique should be used for joining items or lists in a series:</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s01_n02">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Faulty parallelism:</strong> This committee needs to decide whether the company should <strong class="emphasis bold">reduce its workforce, cut its benefits,</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">lowering workers’ wages</strong>.</p>

</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p01">When you are making a comparison, the two items being compared should have a parallel structure. Comparing two items without using parallel structure can lead to confusion about what is being compared. Comparisons frequently use the words <em class="emphasis">than</em> or <em class="emphasis">as</em>, and the items on each side of these comparison words should be parallel. Take a look at the following example:</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s02_n01">

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p04">In the first sentence, the elements before the comparison word (<em class="emphasis">than</em>) are not equal to the elements after the comparison word. It appears that the writer is comparing an action (<em class="emphasis">swimming</em>) with a noun (<em class="emphasis">a pool</em>). In the second sentence, the writer uses the same grammatical construction to create a parallel structure. This clarifies that an action is being compared with another action.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p05">To correct some instances of faulty parallelism, it may be necessary to add or delete words in a sentence.</p>
