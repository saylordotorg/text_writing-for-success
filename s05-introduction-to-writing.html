    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p01">As you begin this chapter, you may be wondering why you need an introduction. After all, you have been writing and reading since elementary school. You completed numerous assessments of your reading and writing skills in high school and as part of your application process for college. You may write on the job, too. Why is a college writing course even necessary?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p02">When you are eager to get started on the coursework in your major that will prepare you for your career, getting excited about an introductory college writing course can be difficult. However, regardless of your field of study, honing your writing skills—and your reading and critical-thinking skills—gives you a more solid academic foundation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p03">In college, academic expectations change from what you may have experienced in high school. The quantity of work you are expected to do is increased. When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your work load can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p04">The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject. Educationally, you are moving into deeper waters. A good introductory writing course will help you swim.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_p07">Throughout this chapter, you will follow a first-year student named Crystal. After several years of working as a saleswoman in a department store, Crystal has decided to pursue a degree in elementary education and become a teacher. She is continuing to work part-time, and occasionally she finds it challenging to balance the demands of work, school, and caring for her four-year-old son.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reading Strategies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_p01">Your college courses will sharpen both your reading and your writing skills. Most of your writing assignments—from brief response papers to in-depth research projects—will depend on your understanding of course reading assignments or related readings you do on your own. And it is difficult, if not impossible, to write effectively about a text that you have not understood. Even when you do understand the reading, it can be hard to write about it if you do not feel personally engaged with the ideas discussed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_p02">This section discusses strategies you can use to get the most out of your college reading assignments. These strategies fall into three broad categories:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Planning strategies.</strong> To help you manage your reading assignments.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Comprehension strategies.</strong> To help you understand the material.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Active reading strategies.</strong> To take your understanding to a higher and deeper level.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Planning Your Reading</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_p01">Have you ever stayed up all night cramming just before an exam? Or found yourself skimming a detailed memo from your boss five minutes before a crucial meeting? The first step in handling college reading successfully is planning. This involves both managing your time and setting a clear purpose for your reading.</p>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Your Reading Time</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">You will learn more detailed strategies for time management in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch01_s02#fresh-ch01_s02">Section 1.2 "Developing Study Skills"</a>, but for now, focus on setting aside enough time for reading and breaking your assignments into manageable chunks. If you are assigned a seventy-page chapter to read for next week’s class, try not to wait until the night before to get started. Give yourself at least a few days and tackle one section at a time.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p02">Your method for breaking up the assignment will depend on the type of reading. If the text is very dense and packed with unfamiliar terms and concepts, you may need to read no more than five or ten pages in one sitting so that you can truly understand and process the information. With more user-friendly texts, you will be able to handle longer sections—twenty to forty pages, for instance. And if you have a highly engaging reading assignment, such as a novel you cannot put down, you may be able to read lengthy passages in one sitting.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p03">As the semester progresses, you will develop a better sense of how much time you need to allow for the reading assignments in different subjects. It also makes sense to preview each assignment well in advance to assess its difficulty level and to determine how much reading time to set aside.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s01_p04">College instructors often set aside reserve readings for a particular course. These consist of articles, book chapters, or other texts that are not part of the primary course textbook. Copies of reserve readings are available through the university library; in print; or, more often, online. When you are assigned a reserve reading, download it ahead of time (and let your instructor know if you have trouble accessing it). Skim through it to get a rough idea of how much time you will need to read the assignment in full.</p>

            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Setting a Purpose</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_p01">The other key component of planning is setting a purpose. Knowing what you want to get out of a reading assignment helps you determine how to approach it and how much time to spend on it. It also helps you stay focused during those occasional moments when it is late, you are tired, and relaxing in front of the television sounds far more appealing than curling up with a stack of journal articles.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_p02">Sometimes your purpose is simple. You might just need to understand the reading material well enough to discuss it intelligently in class the next day. However, your purpose will often go beyond that. For instance, you might also read to compare two texts, to formulate a personal response to a text, or to gather ideas for future research. Here are some questions to ask to help determine your purpose:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_l01">
                    <li>
                        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">How did my instructor frame the assignment?</strong> Often your instructors will tell you what they expect you to get out of the reading:</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s01_s02_l02">
                            <li>Read Chapter 2 and come to class prepared to discuss current teaching practices in elementary math.</li>
                            <li>Read these two articles and compare Smith’s and Jones’s perspectives on the 2010 health care reform bill.</li>
                            <li>Read Chapter 5 and think about how you could apply these guidelines to running your own business.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How deeply do I need to understand the reading?</strong> If you are majoring in computer science and you are assigned to read Chapter 1, “Introduction to Computer Science,” it is safe to assume the chapter presents fundamental concepts that you will be expected to master. However, for some reading assignments, you may be expected to form a general understanding but not necessarily master the content. Again, pay attention to how your instructor presents the assignment.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How does this assignment relate to other course readings or to concepts discussed in class?</strong> Your instructor may make some of these connections explicitly, but if not, try to draw connections on your own. (Needless to say, it helps to take detailed notes both when in class and when you read.)</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How might I use this text again in the future?</strong> If you are assigned to read about a topic that has always interested you, your reading assignment might help you develop ideas for a future research paper. Some reading assignments provide valuable tips or summaries worth bookmarking for future reference. Think about what you can take from the reading that will stay with you.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_p01">You have blocked out time for your reading assignments and set a purpose for reading. Now comes the challenge: making sure you actually understand all the information you are expected to process. Some of your reading assignments will be fairly straightforward. Others, however, will be longer or more complex, so you will need a plan for how to handle them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_p02">For any <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">expository writing</a><span class="glossdef">Writing that conveys facts or descriptions.</span></span>—that is, nonfiction, informational writing—your first comprehension goal is to identify the main points and relate any details to those main points. Because college-level texts can be challenging, you will also need to monitor your reading comprehension. That is, you will need to stop periodically and assess how well you understand what you are reading. Finally, you can improve comprehension by taking time to determine which strategies work best for you and putting those strategies into practice.</p>
            <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Identifying the Main Points</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p01">In college, you will read a wide variety of materials, including the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Textbooks.</strong> These usually include summaries, glossaries, comprehension questions, and other study aids.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Nonfiction trade books.</strong> These are less likely to include the study features found in textbooks.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Popular magazine, newspaper, or web articles.</strong> These are usually written for a general audience.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Scholarly books and journal articles.</strong> These are written for an audience of specialists in a given field.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p02">Regardless of what type of expository text you are assigned to read, your primary comprehension goal is to identify the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">main point</a><span class="glossdef">The most important idea that a writer wants to communicate, often stated early in the writing.</span></span>: the most important idea that the writer wants to communicate and often states early on. Finding the main point gives you a framework to organize the details presented in the reading and relate the reading to concepts you learned in class or through other reading assignments. After identifying the main point, you will find the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">supporting points</a><span class="glossdef">Details, facts, and explanations that develop and clarify a writer’s main point.</span></span>, the details, facts, and explanations that develop and clarify the main point.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p03">Some texts make that task relatively easy. Textbooks, for instance, include the aforementioned features as well as headings and subheadings intended to make it easier for students to identify core concepts. Graphic features, such as sidebars, diagrams, and charts, help students understand complex information and distinguish between essential and inessential points. When you are assigned to read from a textbook, be sure to use available comprehension aids to help you identify the main points.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p04">Trade books and popular articles may not be written specifically for an educational purpose; nevertheless, they also include features that can help you identify the main ideas. These features include the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_l02">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Trade books.</strong> Many trade books include an introduction that presents the writer’s main ideas and purpose for writing. Reading chapter titles (and any subtitles within the chapter) will help you get a broad sense of what is covered. It also helps to read the beginning and ending paragraphs of a chapter closely. These paragraphs often sum up the main ideas presented.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Popular articles.</strong> Reading the headings and introductory paragraphs carefully is crucial. In magazine articles, these features (along with the closing paragraphs) present the main concepts. Hard news articles in newspapers present the gist of the news story in the lead paragraph, while subsequent paragraphs present increasingly general details.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p05">At the far end of the reading difficulty scale are scholarly books and journal articles. Because these texts are written for a specialized, highly educated audience, the authors presume their readers are already familiar with the topic. The language and writing style is sophisticated and sometimes dense.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s01_p06">When you read scholarly books and journal articles, try to apply the same strategies discussed earlier. The introduction usually presents the writer’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay. A thesis statement is often one sentence long, and it states the writer’s point of view.</span></span>, the idea or hypothesis the writer is trying to prove. Headings and subheadings can help you understand how the writer has organized support for his or her thesis. Additionally, academic journal articles often include a summary at the beginning, called an abstract, and electronic databases include summaries of articles, too.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p01">Finding the main idea and paying attention to text features as you read helps you figure out what you should know. Just as important, however, is being able to figure out what you do not know and developing a strategy to deal with it.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p02">Textbooks often include comprehension questions in the margins or at the end of a section or chapter. As you read, stop occasionally to answer these questions on paper or in your head. Use them to identify sections you may need to reread, read more carefully, or ask your instructor about later.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p03">Even when a text does not have built-in comprehension features, you can actively monitor your own comprehension. Try these strategies, adapting them as needed to suit different kinds of texts:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Summarize.</strong> At the end of each section, pause to summarize the main points in a few sentences. If you have trouble doing so, revisit that section.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask and answer questions.</strong> When you begin reading a section, try to identify two to three questions you should be able to answer after you finish it. Write down your questions and use them to test yourself on the reading. If you cannot answer a question, try to determine why. Is the answer buried in that section of reading but just not coming across to you? Or do you expect to find the answer in another part of the reading?</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Do not read in a vacuum.</strong> Look for opportunities to discuss the reading with your classmates. Many instructors set up online discussion forums or blogs specifically for that purpose.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p04">These discussions can also serve as a reality check. If everyone in the class struggled with the reading, it may be exceptionally challenging. If it was a breeze for everyone but you, you may need to see your instructor for help.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p05">As a working mother, Crystal found that the best time to get her reading done was in the evening, after she had put her four-year-old to bed. However, she occasionally had trouble concentrating at the end of a long day. She found that by actively working to summarize the reading and asking and answering questions, she focused better and retained more of what she read. She also found that evenings were a good time to check the class discussion forums that a few of her instructors had created.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s02_s02_p07">Students are often reluctant to seek help. They feel like doing so marks them as slow, weak, or demanding. The truth is, every learner occasionally struggles. If you are sincerely trying to keep up with the course reading but feel like you are in over your head, seek out help. Speak up in class, schedule a meeting with your instructor, or visit your university learning center for assistance.</p>

You know what you need to do to get your reading done and make sure you grasp the main points. However, the most successful students in college are not only competent readers but active, engaged readers.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Using the SQ3R Strategy</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p01">One strategy you can use to become a more active, engaged reader is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SQ3R strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A widely used reading process that involves surveying the text and forming questions before reading; reading to answer questions, predict test material, and form new questions and predictions; reciting or recording the main points of the text; and reviewing and reflecting upon the material.</span></span>, a step-by-step process to follow before, during, and after reading. You may already use some variation of it. In essence, the process works like this:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Survey</strong> the text in advance.</li>
                    <li>Form <strong class="emphasis bold">questions</strong> before you start reading.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read</strong> the text.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Recite</strong> and/or <strong class="emphasis bold">record</strong> important points during and after reading.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Review</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">reflect</strong> on the text after you read.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p02">Before you read, you survey, or preview, the text. As noted earlier, reading introductory paragraphs and headings can help you begin to figure out the author’s main point and identify what important topics will be covered. However, surveying does not stop there. Look over sidebars, photographs, and any other text or graphic features that catch your eye. Skim a few paragraphs. Preview any boldfaced or italicized vocabulary terms. This will help you form a first impression of the material.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p03">Next, start brainstorming questions about the text. What do you expect to learn from the reading? You may find that some questions come to mind immediately based on your initial survey or based on previous readings and class discussions. If not, try using headings and subheadings in the text to formulate questions. For instance, if one heading in your textbook reads “Medicare and Medicaid,” you might ask yourself these questions:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_l02">
                    <li>When was Medicare and Medicaid legislation enacted? Why?</li>
                    <li>What are the major differences between these two programs?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p04">Although some of your questions may be simple factual questions, try to come up with a few that are more open-ended. Asking in-depth questions will help you stay more engaged as you read.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p05">The next step is simple: read. As you read, notice whether your first impressions of the text were correct. Are the author’s main points and overall approach about the same as what you predicted—or does the text contain a few surprises? Also, look for answers to your earlier questions and begin forming new questions. Continue to revise your impressions and questions as you read.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p06">While you are reading, pause occasionally to recite or record important points. It is best to do this at the end of each section or when there is an obvious shift in the writer’s train of thought. Put the book aside for a moment and recite aloud the main points of the section or any important answers you found there. You might also record ideas by jotting down a few brief notes in addition to, or instead of, reciting aloud. Either way, the physical act of articulating information makes you more likely to remember it.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p07">After you have completed the reading, take some time to review the material more thoroughly. If the textbook includes review questions or your instructor has provided a study guide, use these tools to guide your review. You will want to record information in a more detailed format than you used during reading, such as in an outline or a list.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s01_p08">As you review the material, reflect on what you learned. Did anything surprise you, upset you, or make you think? Did you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with any points in the text? What topics would you like to explore further? Jot down your reflections in your notes. (Instructors sometimes require students to write brief response papers or maintain a reading journal. Use these assignments to help you reflect on what you read.)</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s02_p01">The SQ3R process encompasses a number of valuable active reading strategies: previewing a text, making predictions, asking and answering questions, and summarizing. You can use the following additional strategies to further deepen your understanding of what you read.</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s02_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Connect what you read to what you already know.</strong> Look for ways the reading supports, extends, or challenges concepts you have learned elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Relate the reading to your own life.</strong> What statements, people, or situations relate to your personal experiences?</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Visualize.</strong> For both fiction and nonfiction texts, try to picture what is described. Visualizing is especially helpful when you are reading a narrative text, such as a novel or a historical account, or when you read expository text that describes a process, such as how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pay attention to graphics as well as text.</strong> Photographs, diagrams, flow charts, tables, and other graphics can help make abstract ideas more concrete and understandable.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Understand the text in context.</strong> Understanding context means thinking about who wrote the text, when and where it was written, the author’s purpose for writing it, and what assumptions or agendas influenced the author’s ideas. For instance, two writers might both address the subject of health care reform, but if one article is an opinion piece and one is a news story, the context is different.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Plan to talk or write about what you read.</strong> Jot down a few questions or comments in your notebook so you can bring them up in class. (This also gives you a source of topic ideas for papers and presentations later in the semester.) Discuss the reading on a class discussion board or blog about it.</li>

These tools are a great way to reinforce learning. Do not be afraid to be the student who starts the discussion.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s01_s03_s02_p04">Remember that when you interact with other students and teachers online, you need to project a mature, professional image.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Common Writing Assignments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p01">College writing assignments serve a different purpose than the typical writing assignments you completed in high school. In high school, teachers generally focus on teaching you to write in a variety of modes and formats, including personal writing, expository writing, research papers, creative writing, and writing short answers and essays for exams. Over time, these assignments help you build a foundation of writing skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p02">In college, many instructors will expect you to already have that foundation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p03">Your college composition courses will focus on writing for its own sake, helping you make the transition to college-level writing assignments. However, in most other college courses, writing assignments serve a different purpose. In those courses, you may use writing as one tool among many for learning how to think about a particular academic discipline.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p04">Additionally, certain assignments teach you how to meet the expectations for professional writing in a given field. Depending on the class, you might be asked to write a lab report, a case study, a literary analysis, a business plan, or an account of a personal interview. You will need to learn and follow the standard conventions for those types of written products.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p05">Finally, personal and creative writing assignments are less common in college than in high school. College courses emphasize expository writing, writing that explains or informs. Often expository writing assignments will incorporate outside research, too. Some classes will also require persuasive writing assignments in which you state and support your position on an issue. College instructors will hold you to a higher standard when it comes to supporting your ideas with reasons and evidence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s01_s02_p06"><a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch01_s01_s02_t01">Table 1.2 "Common Types of College Writing Assignments"</a> lists some of the most common types of college writing assignments. It includes minor, less formal assignments as well as major ones. Which specific assignments you encounter will depend on the courses you take and the learning objectives developed by your instructors.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_p01">By now, you have a general idea of what to expect from your college courses. You have probably received course syllabi, started on your first few assignments, and begun applying the strategies you learned about in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch01_s01#fresh-ch01_s01">Section 1.1 "Reading and Writing in College"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_p02">At the beginning of the semester, your work load is relatively light. This is the perfect time to brush up on your study skills and establish good habits. When the demands on your time and energy become more intense, you will have a system in place for handling them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_p03">This section covers specific strategies for managing your time effectively. You will also learn about different note-taking systems that you can use to organize and record information efficiently.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_p04">As you work through this section, remember that every student is different. The strategies presented here are tried and true techniques that work well for many people. However, you may need to adapt them slightly to develop a system that works well for you personally. If your friend swears by her smartphone, but you hate having to carry extra electronic gadgets around, then using a smartphone will not be the best organizational strategy for you.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_p05">Read with an open mind, and consider what techniques have been effective (or ineffective) for you in the past. Which habits from your high school years or your work life could help you succeed in college? Which habits might get in your way? What changes might you need to make?</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Understanding Yourself as a Learner</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_p01">To succeed in college—or any situation where you must master new concepts and skills—it helps to know what makes you tick. For decades, educational researchers and organizational psychologists have examined how people take in and assimilate new information, how some people learn differently than others, and what conditions make students and workers most productive. Here are just a few questions to think about:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What is your learning style?</strong> For the purposes of this chapter, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">learning style</a><span class="glossdef">The way a learner prefers to take in new information.</span></span> refers to the way you prefer to take in new information, by seeing, by listening, or through some other channel. For more information, see the section on learning styles.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What times of day are you most productive?</strong> If your energy peaks early, you might benefit from blocking out early morning time for studying or writing. If you are a night owl, set aside a few evenings a week for schoolwork.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How much clutter can you handle in your work space?</strong> Some people work fine at a messy desk and know exactly where to find what they need in their stack of papers; however, most people benefit from maintaining a neat, organized space.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How well do you juggle potential distractions in your environment?</strong> If you can study at home without being tempted to turn on the television, check your e-mail, fix yourself a snack, and so on, you may make home your work space. However, if you need a less distracting environment to stay focused, you may be able to find one on your college’s campus or in your community.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Does a little background noise help or hinder your productivity?</strong> Some people work better when listening to background music or the low hum of conversation in a coffee shop. Others need total silence.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">When you work with a partner or group, do you stay on task?</strong> A study partner or group can sometimes be invaluable. However, working this way takes extra planning and effort, so be sure to use the time productively. If you find that group study sessions turn into social occasions, you may study better on your own.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How do you manage stress?</strong> Accept that at certain points in the semester, you will feel stressed out. In your day-to-day routine, make time for activities that help you reduce stress, such as exercising, spending time with friends, or just scheduling downtime to relax.</li>
        </ul>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_p01">Most people have one channel that works best for them when it comes to taking in new information. Knowing yours can help you develop strategies for studying, time management, and note taking that work especially well for you.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_p02">To begin identifying your learning style, think about how you would go about the process of assembling a piece of furniture. Which of these options sounds most like you?</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_l01" numeration="loweralpha">
                <li>You would carefully look over the diagrams in the assembly manual first so you could picture each step in the process.</li>
                <li>You would silently read the directions through, step by step, and then look at the diagrams afterward.</li>
                <li>You would read the directions aloud under your breath. Having someone explain the steps to you would also help.</li>
                <li>You would start putting the pieces together and figure out the process through trial and error, consulting the directions as you worked.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_p03">Now read the following explanations. Again, think about whether each description sounds like you.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_l02">

You understand ideas best when they are presented in a visual format, such as a flowchart, a diagram, or text with clear headings and many photos or illustrations.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_p04">Your learning style does not completely define you as a student. Auditory learners can comprehend a flow chart, and kinesthetic learners can sit still long enough to read a book. However, if you do have one dominant learning style, you can work with it to get the most out of your classes and study time. <a class="xref" href="#fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_t01">Table 1.3 "Learning Style Strategies"</a> lists some tips for maximizing your learning style.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s01_s01_p05">The material presented here about learning styles is just the tip of the iceberg. There are numerous other variations in how people learn. Some people like to act on information right away while others reflect on it first. Some people excel at mastering details and understanding concrete, tried and true ideas while others enjoy exploring abstract theories and innovative, even impractical ideas.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Time Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_p01">In college you have increased freedom to structure your time as you please. With that freedom comes increased responsibility. High school teachers often take it upon themselves to track down students who miss class or forget assignments. College instructors, however, expect you to take full responsibility for managing yourself and getting your work done on time.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Getting Started: Short- and Long-Term Planning</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s01_p01">At the beginning of the semester, establish a weekly routine for when you will study and write. A general guideline is that for every hour spent in class, students should expect to spend another two to three hours on reading, writing, and studying for tests. Therefore, if you are taking a biology course that meets three times a week for an hour at a time, you can expect to spend six to nine hours per week on it outside of class. You will need to budget time for each class just like an employer schedules shifts at work, and you must make that study time a priority.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s01_p02">That may sound like a lot when taking multiple classes, but if you plan your time carefully, it is manageable. A typical full-time schedule of fifteen credit hours translates into thirty to forty-five hours per week spent on schoolwork outside of class. All in all, a full-time student would spend about as much time on school each week as an employee spends on work. Balancing school and a job can be more challenging, but still doable.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s01_p03">In addition to setting aside regular work periods, you will need to plan ahead to handle more intense demands, such as studying for exams and writing major papers. At the beginning of the semester, go through your course syllabi and mark all major due dates and exam dates on a calendar. Use a format that you check regularly, such as your smartphone or the calendar feature in your e-mail. (In <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch01_s03#fresh-ch01_s03">Section 1.3 "Becoming a Successful College Writer"</a> you will learn strategies for planning out major writing assignments so you can complete them on time.)</p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s01_p04">The two- to three-hour rule may sound intimidating. However, keep in mind that this is only a rule of thumb. Realistically, some courses will be more challenging than others, and the demands will ebb and flow throughout the semester. You may have trouble-free weeks and stressful weeks. When you schedule your classes, try to balance introductory-level classes with more advanced classes so that your work load stays manageable.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s01_p05">Crystal knew that to balance a job, college classes, and a family, it was crucial for her to get organized. For the month of September, she drew up a week-by-week calendar that listed not only her own class and work schedules but also the days her son attended preschool and the days her husband had off from work. She and her husband discussed how to share their day-to-day household responsibilities so she would be able to get her schoolwork done. Crystal also made a note to talk to her supervisor at work about reducing her hours during finals week in December.</p>

                    <li>Working with your class schedule, map out a week-long schedule of study time. Try to apply the “two- to three-hour” rule. Be sure to include any other nonnegotiable responsibilities, such as a job or child care duties.</li>
                    <li>Use your course syllabi to record exam dates and due dates for major assignments in a calendar (paper or electronic). Use a star, highlighting, or other special marking to set off any days or weeks that look especially demanding.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p01">Setting up a schedule is easy. Sticking with it, however, may create challenges. A schedule that looked great on paper may prove to be unrealistic. Sometimes, despite students’ best intentions, they end up procrastinating or pulling all-nighters to finish a paper or study for an exam.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p02">Keep in mind, however, that your weekly schedule and semester calendar are time-management tools. Like any tools, their effectiveness depends on the user: you. If you leave a tool sitting in the box unused (e.g., if you set up your schedule and then forget about it), it will not help you complete the task. And if, for some reason, a particular tool or strategy is not getting the job done, you need to figure out why and maybe try using something else.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s02_s02_p03">With that in mind, read the list of time-management dos and don’ts. Keep this list handy as a reference you can use throughout the semester to “troubleshoot” if you feel like your schoolwork is getting off track.</p>

                    <li>Be realistic when you schedule study time. Do not plan to write your paper on Friday night when everyone else is out socializing. When Friday comes, you might end up abandoning your plans and hanging out with your friends instead.</li>
                    <li>Be honest with yourself about where your time goes. Do not fritter away your study time on distractions like e-mail and social networking sites.</li>
                    <li>Accept that occasionally your work may get a little off track. No one is perfect.</li>
                    <li>Accept that sometimes you may not have time for all the fun things you would like to do.</li>
                    <li>Recognize times when you feel overextended. Sometimes you may just need to get through an especially demanding week. However, if you feel exhausted and overworked all the time, you may need to scale back on some of your commitments.</li>
                    <li>Have a plan for handling high-stress periods, such as final exam week. Try to reduce your other commitments during those periods—for instance, by scheduling time off from your job. Build in some time for relaxing activities, too.</li>

For instance, if you have a free half hour between classes, use it to preview a chapter or brainstorm ideas for an essay.</li>
                    <li>Do not fall into the trap of letting things slide and promising yourself, “I will do better next week.” When next week comes, the accumulated undone tasks will seem even more intimidating, and you will find it harder to get them done.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_p01">One final valuable tool to have in your arsenal as a student is a good note-taking system. Just the act of converting a spoken lecture to notes helps you organize and retain information, and of course, good notes also help you review important concepts later. Although taking good notes is an essential study skill, many students enter college without having received much guidance about note taking.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_p02">These sections discuss different strategies you can use to take notes efficiently. No matter which system you choose, keep the note-taking guidelines in mind.</p>

                <li>Before class, quickly review your notes from the previous class and the assigned reading. Fixing key terms and concepts in your mind will help you stay focused and pick out the important points during the lecture.</li>
                <li>Come prepared with paper, pens, highlighters, textbooks, and any important handouts.</li>
                <li>Come to class with a positive attitude and a readiness to learn. During class, make a point of concentrating. Ask questions if you need to. Be an active participant.</li>
                <li>During class, capture important ideas as concisely as you can. Use words or phrases instead of full sentences and abbreviate when possible.</li>
                <li>Visually organize your notes into main topics, subtopics, and supporting points, and show the relationships between ideas. Leave space if necessary so you can add more details under important topics or subtopics.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_p01">A good note-taking system needs to help you differentiate among major points, related subtopics, and supporting details. It visually represents the connections between ideas. Finally, to be effective, your note-taking system must allow you to record and organize information fairly quickly. Although some students like to create detailed, formal outlines or concept maps when they read, these may not be good strategies for class notes, because spoken lectures may not allow time for elaborate notes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_p02">Instead, focus on recording content simply and quickly to create organized, legible notes. Try one of the following techniques.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s01_p01">A modified outline format uses indented spacing to show the hierarchy of ideas without including roman numerals, lettering, and so forth. Just use a dash or bullet to signify each new point unless your instructor specifically presents a numbered list of items.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s01_p02">The first example shows Crystal’s notes from a developmental psychology class about an important theorist in this field. Notice how the line for the main topic is all the way to the left. Subtopics are indented, and supporting details are indented one level further. Crystal also used abbreviations for terms like <em class="emphasis">development</em> and <em class="emphasis">example</em>.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s04_p01">In addition to the general techniques already described, you might find it useful to practice a specific strategy known as the Cornell note-taking system. This popular format makes it easy not only to organize information clearly but also to note key terms and summarize content.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s04_p02">To use the Cornell system, begin by setting up the page with these components:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s04_l01">
                    <li>The course name and lecture date at the top of the page</li>
                    <li>A narrow column (about two inches) at the left side of the page</li>
                    <li>A wide column (about five to six inches) on the right side of the page</li>
                    <li>A space of a few lines marked off at the bottom of the page</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s04_p03">During the lecture, you record notes in the wide column. You can do so using the traditional modified outline format or a more visual format if you prefer.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s04_p04">Then, as soon as possible after the lecture, review your notes and identify key terms. Jot these down in the narrow left-hand column. You can use this column as a study aid by covering the notes on the right-hand side, reviewing the key terms, and trying to recall as much as you can about them so that you can mentally restate the main points of the lecture. Uncover the notes on the right to check your understanding. Finally, use the space at the bottom of the page to summarize each page of notes in a few sentences.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s04_p05">Using the Cornell system, Crystal’s notes would look like the following:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s02_s03_s01_s04_p06">Often, at school or in the workplace, a speaker will provide you with pregenerated notes summarizing electronic presentation slides. You may be tempted not to take notes at all because much of the content is already summarized for you. However, it is a good idea to jot down at least a few notes. Doing so keeps you focused during the presentation, allows you to record details you might otherwise forget, and gives you the opportunity to jot down questions or reflections to personalize the content.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p01">To complete a writing project successfully, good writers use some variation of the following process.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_n01">
                <h3 class="title">The Writing Process</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prewriting.</strong> In this step, the writer generates ideas to write about and begins developing these ideas.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Outlining a structure of ideas.</strong> In this step, the writer determines the overall organizational structure of the writing and creates an outline to organize ideas. Usually this step involves some additional fleshing out of the ideas generated in the first step.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Writing a rough draft.</strong> In this step, the writer uses the work completed in prewriting to develop a first draft. The draft covers the ideas the writer brainstormed and follows the organizational plan that was laid out in the first step.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Revising.</strong> In this step, the writer revisits the draft to review and, if necessary, reshape its content. This stage involves moderate and sometimes major changes: adding or deleting a paragraph, phrasing the main point differently, expanding on an important idea, reorganizing content, and so forth.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Editing.</strong> In this step, the writer reviews the draft to make additional changes. Editing involves making changes to improve style and adherence to standard writing conventions—for instance, replacing a vague word with a more precise one or fixing errors in grammar and spelling. Once this stage is complete, the work is a finished piece and ready to share with others.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p02">Chances are, you have already used this process as a writer. You may also have used it for other types of creative projects, such as developing a sketch into a finished painting or composing a song. The steps listed above apply broadly to any project that involves creative thinking. You come up with ideas (often vague at first), you work to give them some structure, you make a first attempt, you figure out what needs improving, and then you refine it until you are satisfied.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p03">Most people have used this creative process in one way or another, but many people have misconceptions about how to use it to write. Here are a few of the most common misconceptions students have about the writing process:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_l02">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“I do not have to waste time on prewriting if I understand the assignment.”</strong> Even if the task is straightforward and you feel ready to start writing, take some time to develop ideas before you plunge into your draft. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Freewriting</a><span class="glossdef">A prewriting strategy in which writers write freely about any topic for a set amount of time (usually three to five minutes).</span></span>—writing about the topic without stopping for a set period of time—is one prewriting technique you might try in that situation.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“It is important to complete a formal, numbered outline for every writing assignment.”</strong> For some assignments, such as lengthy research papers, proceeding without a formal outline can be very difficult. However, for other assignments, a structured set of notes or a detailed graphic organizer may suffice. The important thing is that you have a solid plan for organizing ideas and details.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“My draft will be better if I write it when I am feeling inspired.”</strong> By all means, take advantage of those moments of inspiration. However, understand that sometimes you will have to write when you are not in the mood. Sit down and start your draft even if you do not feel like it. If necessary, force yourself to write for just one hour. By the end of the hour, you may be far more engaged and motivated to continue. If not, at least you will have accomplished part of the task.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“My instructor will tell me everything I need to revise.”</strong> If your instructor chooses to review drafts, the feedback can help you improve. However, it is still your job, not your instructor’s, to transform the draft to a final, polished piece. That task will be much easier if you give your best effort to the draft before submitting it. During revision, do not just go through and implement your instructor’s corrections. Take time to determine what you can change to make the work the best it can be.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“I am a good writer, so I do not need to revise or edit.”</strong> Even talented writers still need to revise and edit their work. At the very least, doing so will help you catch an embarrassing typo or two. Revising and editing are the steps that make good writers into great writers.</li>
            </ul>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p05">The writing process also applies to timed writing tasks, such as essay exams. Before you begin writing, read the question thoroughly and think about the main points to include in your response. Use scrap paper to sketch out a very brief outline. Keep an eye on the clock as you write your response so you will have time to review it and make any needed changes before turning in your exam.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Your Time</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p01">In <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch01_s02#fresh-ch01_s02">Section 1.2 "Developing Study Skills"</a>, you learned general time-management skills. By combining those skills with what you have learned about the writing process, you can make any writing assignment easier to manage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p02">When your instructor gives you a writing assignment, write the due date on your calendar. Then work backward from the due date to set aside blocks of time when you will work on the assignment. Always plan at least two sessions of writing time per assignment, so that you are not trying to move from step 1 to step 5 in one evening. Trying to work that fast is stressful, and it does not yield great results. You will plan better, think better, and write better if you space out the steps.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p03">Ideally, you should set aside at least three separate blocks of time to work on a writing assignment: one for prewriting and outlining, one for drafting, and one for revising and editing. Sometimes those steps may be compressed into just a few days. If you have a couple of weeks to work on a paper, space out the five steps over multiple sessions. Long-term projects, such as research papers, require more time for each step.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p04">In certain situations you may not be able to allow time between the different steps of the writing process. For instance, you may be asked to write in class or complete a brief response paper overnight. If the time available is very limited, apply a modified version of the writing process (as you would do for an essay exam). It is still important to give the assignment thought and effort. However, these types of assignments are less formal, and instructors may not expect them to be as polished as formal papers. When in doubt, ask the instructor about expectations, resources that will be available during the writing exam, and if they have any tips to prepare you to effectively demonstrate your writing skills.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p05">Each Monday in Crystal’s Foundations of Education class, the instructor distributed copies of a current news article on education and assigned students to write a one-and-one-half- to two-page response that was due the following Monday. Together, these weekly assignments counted for 20 percent of the course grade. Although each response took just a few hours to complete, Crystal found that she learned more from the reading and got better grades on her writing if she spread the work out in the following way:</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Setting Goals</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p01">One key to succeeding as a student and as a writer is setting both short- and long-term goals for yourself. You have already glimpsed the kind of short-term goals a student might set. Crystal wanted to do well in her Foundations of Education course, and she realized that she could control how she handled her weekly writing assignments. At 20 percent of her course grade, she reasoned, those assignments might mean the difference between a C and a B or between a B and an A.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p02">By planning carefully and following through on her daily and weekly goals, Crystal was able to fulfill one of her goals for the semester. Although her exam scores were not as high as she had hoped, her consistently strong performance on writing assignments tipped her grade from a B+ to an A−. She was pleased to have earned a high grade in one of the required courses for her major. She was also glad to have gotten the most out of an introductory course that would help her become an effective teacher.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p03">How does Crystal’s experience relate to your own college experience?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p04">To do well in college, it is important to stay focused on how your day-to-day actions determine your long-term success. You may not have defined your career goals or chosen a major yet. Even so, you surely have some overarching goals for what you want out of college: to expand your career options, to increase your earning power, or just to learn something new. In time, you will define your long-term goals more explicitly. Doing solid, steady work, day by day and week by week, will help you meet those goals.</p>

                    <li>For this step, identify one long-term goal you would like to have achieved by the time you complete your degree. For instance, you might want a particular job in your field or hope to graduate with honors.</li>
                    <li>Next, identify one semester goal that will help you fulfill the goal you set in step one. For instance, you may want to do well in a particular course or establish a connection with a professional in your field.</li>
                    <li>Review the goal you determined in step two. Brainstorm a list of stepping stones that will help you meet that goal, such as “doing well on my midterm and final exams” or “talking to Professor Gibson about doing an internship.” Write down everything you can think of that would help you meet that semester goal.</li>
                    <li>Review your list. Choose two to three items, and for each item identify at least one concrete action you can take to accomplish it. These actions may be recurring (meeting with a study group each week) or one time only (calling the professor in charge of internships).</li>
                    <li>Identify one action from step four that you can do today. Then do it.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Using College Resources</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p01">One reason students sometimes find college overwhelming is that they do not know about, or are reluctant to use, the resources available to them. Some aspects of college will be challenging. However, if you try to handle every challenge alone, you may become frustrated and overwhelmed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p02">Universities have resources in place to help students cope with challenges. Your student fees help pay for resources such as a health center or tutoring, so use these resources if you need them. The following are some of the resources you might use if you find you need help:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Your instructor.</strong> If you are making an honest effort but still struggling with a particular course, set up a time to meet with your instructor and discuss what you can do to improve. He or she may be able to shed light on a confusing concept or give you strategies to catch up.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Your academic counselor.</strong> Many universities assign students an academic counselor who can help you choose courses and ensure that you fulfill degree and major requirements.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The academic resource center.</strong> These centers offer a variety of services, which may range from general coaching in study skills to tutoring for specific courses. Find out what is offered at your school and use the services that you need.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The writing center.</strong> These centers employ tutors to help you manage college-level writing assignments. They will not write or edit your paper for you, but they can help you through the stages of the writing process. (In some schools, the writing center is part of the academic resource center.)</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The career resource center.</strong> Visit the career resource center for guidance in choosing a career path, developing a résumé, and finding and applying for jobs.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Counseling services.</strong> Many universities offer psychological counseling for free or for a low fee. Use these services if you need help coping with a difficult personal situation or managing depression, anxiety, or other problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch01_s03_s01_s04_p03">Students sometimes neglect to use available resources due to limited time, unwillingness to admit there is a problem, or embarrassment about needing to ask for help. Unfortunately, ignoring a problem usually makes it harder to cope with later on. Waiting until the end of the semester may also mean fewer resources are available, since many other students are also seeking last-minute help.</p>
