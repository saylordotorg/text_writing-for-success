        <h2 class="title editable block">The Purpose of Definition in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p01">The purpose of a definition essay may seem self-explanatory: the purpose of the definition essay is to simply define something. But defining terms in writing is often more complicated than just consulting a dictionary. In fact, the way we define terms can have far-reaching consequences for individuals as well as collective groups.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p02">Take, for example, a word like <em class="emphasis">alcoholism</em>. The way in which one defines alcoholism depends on its legal, moral, and medical contexts. Lawyers may define alcoholism in terms of its legality; parents may define alcoholism in terms of its morality; and doctors will define alcoholism in terms of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Think also of terms that people tend to debate in our broader culture. How we define words, such as <em class="emphasis">marriage</em> and <em class="emphasis">climate change</em>, has enormous impact on policy decisions and even on daily decisions. Think about conversations couples may have in which words like <em class="emphasis">commitment</em>, <em class="emphasis">respect</em>, or <em class="emphasis">love</em> need clarification.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p03">Defining terms within a relationship, or any other context, can at first be difficult, but once a definition is established between two people or a group of people, it is easier to have productive dialogues. Definitions, then, establish the way in which people communicate ideas. They set parameters for a given discourse, which is why they are so important.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p04">When writing definition essays, avoid terms that are too simple, that lack complexity. Think in terms of concepts, such as <em class="emphasis">hero</em>, <em class="emphasis">immigration</em>, or <em class="emphasis">loyalty</em>, rather than physical objects. Definitions of concepts, rather than objects, are often fluid and contentious, making for a more effective definition essay.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p05">Definitions play a critical role in all workplace environments. Take the term <em class="emphasis">sexual harassment</em>, for example. Sexual harassment is broadly defined on the federal level, but each company may have additional criteria that define it further. Knowing how your workplace defines and treats all sexual harassment allegations is important. Think, too, about how your company defines <em class="emphasis">lateness</em>, <em class="emphasis">productivity</em>, or <em class="emphasis">contributions</em>.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercise 1</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s01_p06">On a separate sheet of paper, write about a time in your own life in which the definition of a word, or the lack of a definition, caused an argument. Your term could be something as simple as the category of an all-star in sports or how to define a good movie. Or it could be something with higher stakes and wider impact, such as a political argument. Explain how the conversation began, how the argument hinged on the definition of the word, and how the incident was finally resolved.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Structure of a Definition Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p01">The definition essay opens with a general discussion of the term to be defined. You then state as your thesis your definition of the term.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p02">The rest of the essay should explain the rationale for your definition. Remember that a dictionary’s definition is limiting, and you should not rely strictly on the dictionary entry. Instead, consider the context in which you are using the word. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Context</a><span class="glossdef">The circumstances, conditions, or setting in which something exists or occurs.</span></span> identifies the circumstances, conditions, or setting in which something exists or occurs. Often words take on different meanings depending on the context in which they are used. For example, the ideal leader in a battlefield setting could likely be very different than a leader in an elementary school setting. If a context is missing from the essay, the essay may be too short or the main points could be confusing or misunderstood.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p03">The remainder of the essay should explain different aspects of the term’s definition. For example, if you were defining a good leader in an elementary classroom setting, you might define such a leader according to personality traits: patience, consistency, and flexibility. Each attribute would be explained in its own paragraph.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p04">For definition essays, try to think of concepts that you have a personal stake in. You are more likely to write a more engaging definition essay if you are writing about an idea that has personal value and importance.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Writing at Work</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s02_p05">It is a good idea to occasionally assess your role in the workplace. You can do this through the process of definition. Identify your role at work by defining not only the routine tasks but also those gray areas where your responsibilities might overlap with those of others. Coming up with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities can add value to your résumé and even increase productivity in the workplace.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing a Definition Essay</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s03_p01">Choose a topic that will be complex enough to be discussed at length. Choosing a word or phrase of personal relevance often leads to a more interesting and engaging essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s03_p02">After you have chosen your word or phrase, start your essay with an introduction that establishes the relevancy of the term in the chosen specific context. Your thesis comes at the end of the introduction, and it should clearly state your definition of the term in the specific context. Establishing a functional context from the beginning will orient readers and minimize misunderstandings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch10_s06_s03_p03">The body paragraphs should each be dedicated to explaining a different facet of your definition. Make sure to use clear examples and strong details to illustrate your points. Your concluding paragraph should pull together all the different elements of your definition to ultimately reinforce your thesis.
