        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch09_s03_l01">
            <li>Understand how and why organizational techniques help writers and readers stay focused.</li>
            <li>Assess how and when to use chronological order to organize an essay.</li>
            <li>Recognize how and when to use order of importance to organize an essay.</li>
            <li>Determine how and when to use spatial order to organize an essay.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p01">The method of organization you choose for your essay is just as important as its content. Without a clear organizational pattern, your reader could become confused and lose interest. The way you structure your essay helps your readers draw connections between the body and the thesis, and the structure also keeps you focused as you plan and write the essay. Choosing your organizational pattern before you outline ensures that each body paragraph works to support and develop your thesis.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p02">This section covers three ways to organize body paragraphs:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_l02">
        <li>Chronological order</li>
        <li>Order of importance</li>
        <li>Spatial order</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p03">When you begin to draft your essay, your ideas may seem to flow from your mind in a seemingly random manner. Your readers, who bring to the table different backgrounds, viewpoints, and ideas, need you to clearly organize these ideas in order to help process and accept them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_p04">A solid organizational pattern gives your ideas a path that you can follow as you develop your draft. Knowing how you will organize your paragraphs allows you to better express and analyze your thoughts. Planning the structure of your essay before you choose supporting evidence helps you conduct more effective and targeted research.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Chronological Order</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p01">In <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>, you learned that chronological arrangement has the following purposes:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>To explain the history of an event or a topic</li>
            <li>To tell a story or relate an experience</li>
            <li>To explain how to do or to make something</li>
            <li>To explain the steps in a process</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Chronological order</a><span class="glossdef">An organizational method that arranges events or steps in the order that they have occurred or will occur.</span></span> is mostly used in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">expository writing</a><span class="glossdef">Writing that conveys facts or descriptions.</span></span>, which is a form of writing that narrates, describes, informs, or explains a process. When using chronological order, arrange the events in the order that they actually happened, or will happen if you are giving instructions. This method requires you to use words such as <em class="emphasis">first</em>, <em class="emphasis">second</em>, <em class="emphasis">then</em>, <em class="emphasis">after that</em>, <em class="emphasis">later</em>, and <em class="emphasis">finally</em>. These transition words guide you and your reader through the paper as you expand your thesis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p03">For example, if you are writing an essay about the history of the airline industry, you would begin with its conception and detail the essential timeline events up until present day. You would follow the chain of events using words such as <em class="emphasis">first</em>, <em class="emphasis">then</em>, <em class="emphasis">next</em>, and so on.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p04">At some point in your career you may have to file a complaint with your human resources department. Using chronological order is a useful tool in describing the events that led up to your filing the grievance. You would logically lay out the events in the order that they occurred using the key transition words. The more logical your complaint, the more likely you will be well received and helped.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercise 1</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p05">Choose an accomplishment you have achieved in your life. The important moment could be in sports, schooling, or extracurricular activities. On your own sheet of paper, list the steps you took to reach your goal. Try to be as specific as possible with the steps you took. Pay attention to using transition words to focus your writing.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p06">Keep in mind that chronological order is most appropriate for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_l02">
            <li>Writing essays containing heavy research</li>
            <li>Writing essays with the aim of listing, explaining, or narrating</li>
            <li>Writing essays that analyze literary works such as poems, plays, or books</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_n03">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p07">When using chronological order, your introduction should indicate the information you will cover and in what order, and the introduction should also establish the relevance of the information. Your body paragraphs should then provide clear divisions or steps in chronology. You can divide your paragraphs by time (such as decades, wars, or other historical events) or by the same structure of the work you are examining (such as a line-by-line explication of a poem).</p>

        <div class="exercises editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_n04">
            <h3 class="title">Exercise 2</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s01_p08">On a separate sheet of paper, write a paragraph that describes a process you are familiar with and can do well. Assume that your reader is unfamiliar with the procedure. Remember to use the chronological key words, such as <em class="emphasis">first</em>, <em class="emphasis">second</em>, <em class="emphasis">then</em>, and <em class="emphasis">finally</em>.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Order of Importance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p01">Recall from <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a> that <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">order of importance</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to their significance.</span></span> is best used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Persuading and convincing</li>
            <li>Ranking items by their importance, benefit, or significance</li>
            <li>Illustrating a situation, problem, or solution</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p02">Most essays move from the least to the most important point, and the paragraphs are arranged in an effort to build the essayâ€™s strength. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to begin with your most important supporting point, such as in an essay that contains a thesis that is highly debatable. When writing a persuasive essay, it is best to begin with the most important point because it immediately captivates your readers and compels them to continue reading.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p03">For example, if you were supporting your thesis that homework is detrimental to the education of high school students, you would want to present your most convincing argument first, and then move on to the less important points for your case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p04">Some key transitional words you should use with this method of organization are <em class="emphasis">most importantly</em>, <em class="emphasis">almost as importantly</em>, <em class="emphasis">just as importantly</em>, and <em class="emphasis">finally</em>.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p05">During your career, you may be required to work on a team that devises a strategy for a specific goal of your company, such as increasing profits. When planning your strategy you should organize your steps in order of importance. This demonstrates the ability to prioritize and plan. Using the order of importance technique also shows that you can create a resolution with logical steps for accomplishing a common goal.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s02_p06">On a separate sheet of paper, write a paragraph that discusses a passion of yours.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Spatial Order</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s03_p01">As stated in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spatial order</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to physical characteristics or appearance.</span></span> is best used for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Helping readers visualize something as you want them to see it</li>

            <li>Writing a descriptive essay</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s03_p02">Spatial order means that you explain or describe objects as they are arranged around you in your space, for example in a bedroom. As the writer, you create a picture for your reader, and their perspective is the viewpoint from which you describe what is around you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s03_p03">The view must move in an orderly, logical progression, giving the reader clear directional signals to follow from place to place. The key to using this method is to choose a specific starting point and then guide the reader to follow your eye as it moves in an orderly trajectory from your starting point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s03_p04">Pay attention to the following studentâ€™s description of her bedroom and how she guides the reader through the viewing process, foot by foot.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s03_p06">The following are possible transition words to include when using spatial order:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch09_s03_s03_l02">
            <li>Just to the left or just to the right</li>

            <li>On the left or on the right</li>
            <li>Across from</li>
            <li>A little further down</li>
            <li>To the south, to the east, and so on</li>
