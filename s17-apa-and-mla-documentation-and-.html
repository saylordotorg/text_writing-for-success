It provides a uniform framework for the manuscript and parenthetical citations, or in-text citations.

There are a few major formatting styles used in academic texts, including AMA, Chicago, and Turabian:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_l02">
        <li>AMA (American Medical Association) for medicine, health, and biological sciences</li>
        <li>APA (American Psychological Association) for education, psychology, and the social sciences</li>
        <li>Chicago—a common style used in everyday publications like magazines, newspapers, and books</li>
        <li>MLA (Modern Language Association) for English, literature, arts, and humanities</li>
        <li>Turabian—another common style designed for its universal application across all subjects and disciplines</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p02">While all the formatting and citation styles have their own use and applications, in this chapter we focus our attention on the two styles you are most likely to use in your academic studies: APA and MLA.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p03">If you find that the rules of proper source documentation are difficult to keep straight, you are not alone. Writing a good research paper is, in and of itself, a major intellectual challenge. Having to follow detailed citation and formatting guidelines as well may seem like just one more task to add to an already-too-long list of requirements.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p04">Following these guidelines, however, serves several important purposes. First, it signals to your readers that your paper should be taken seriously as a student’s contribution to a given academic or professional field; it is the literary equivalent of wearing a tailored suit to a job interview. Second, it shows that you respect other people’s work enough to give them proper credit for it. Finally, it helps your reader find additional materials if he or she wishes to learn more about your topic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_p05">Furthermore, producing a letter-perfect APA-style paper need not be burdensome. Yes, it requires careful attention to detail. However, you can simplify the process if you keep these broad guidelines in mind:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_l03">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Work ahead whenever you can.</strong> <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a> includes tips for keeping track of your sources early in the research process, which will save time later on.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get it right the first time.</strong> Apply APA guidelines as you write, so you will not have much to correct during the editing stage. Again, putting in a little extra time early on can save time later.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use the resources available to you.</strong> In addition to the guidelines provided in this chapter, you may wish to consult the APA website at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.apa.org">http://www.apa.org</a> or the Purdue University Online Writing lab at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu">http://owl.english.purdue.edu</a>, which regularly updates its online style guidelines.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s01_p01">This chapter provides detailed guidelines for using the citation and formatting conventions developed by the American Psychological Association, or APA.

APA style provides formatting guidelines for five levels of section and subsection headings; however, most college research papers require only one or two heading levels.</span></span> to organize information, making it easy for the reader to follow the writer’s train of thought and to know immediately what major topics are covered. Depending on the length and complexity of the paper, its major sections may also be divided into subsections, sub-subsections, and so on.

            <h2 class="title editable block">In-Text Citations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p01">Throughout the body of your paper, include a citation whenever you quote or paraphrase material from your research sources. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch11#fresh-ch11">Chapter 11 "Writing from Research: What Will I Learn?"</a>, the purpose of citations is twofold: to give credit to others for their ideas and to allow your reader to follow up and learn more about the topic if desired. Your in-text citations provide basic information about your source; each source you cite will have a longer entry in the references section that provides more detailed information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p02">In-text citations must provide the name of the author or authors and the year the source was published. (When a given source does not list an individual author, you may provide the source title or the name of the organization that published the material instead.) When directly quoting a source, it is also required that you include the page number where the quote appears in your citation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p03">This information may be included within the sentence or in a parenthetical reference at the end of the sentence, as in these examples.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p11">Another variation is to introduce the author and the source title in your sentence and include the publication date and page number in parentheses within the sentence or at the end of the sentence. As long as you have included the essential information, you can choose the option that works best for that particular sentence and source.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s01_p12">Citing a book with a single author is usually a straightforward task. Of course, your research may require that you cite many other types of sources, such as books or articles with more than one author or sources with no individual author listed. You may also need to cite sources available in both print and online and nonprint sources, such as websites and personal interviews. <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13#fresh-ch13">Chapter 13 "APA and MLA Documentation and Formatting"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13_s02#fresh-ch13_s02">Section 13.2 "Citing and Referencing Techniques"</a> and <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch13_s03#fresh-ch13_s03">Section 13.3 "Creating a References Section"</a> provide extensive guidelines for citing a variety of source types.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s02_p01">The brief citations included in the body of your paper correspond to the more detailed citations provided at the end of the paper in the references section. In-text citations provide basic information—the author’s name, the publication date, and the page number if necessary—while the references section provides more extensive bibliographical information. Again, this information allows your reader to follow up on the sources you cited and do additional reading about the topic if desired.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s02_p02">The specific format of entries in the list of references varies slightly for different source types, but the entries generally include the following information:</p>

                <li>The name(s) of the author(s) or institution that wrote the source</li>
                <li>The year of publication and, where applicable, the exact date of publication</li>
                <li>The full title of the source</li>
                <li>For books, the city of publication</li>
                <li>For articles or essays, the name of the periodical or book in which the article or essay appears</li>
                <li>For magazine and journal articles, the volume number, issue number, and pages where the article appears</li>
                <li>For sources on the web, the URL where the source is located</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s01_s02_s02_p03">The references page is double spaced and lists entries in alphabetical order by the author’s last name.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s02_s01_s01_p01">For brief quotations—fewer than forty words—use quotation marks to indicate where the quoted material begins and ends, and cite the name of the author(s), the year of publication, and the page number where the quotation appears in your source. Remember to include commas to separate elements within the parenthetical citation. Also, avoid redundancy. If you name the author(s) in your sentence, do not repeat the name(s) in your parenthetical citation. Review following the examples of different ways to cite direct quotations.</p>

Additionally, these exercises help women maintain muscle mass and overall strength, and many common forms of weight-bearing exercise, such as brisk walking or stair climbing, also provide noticeable cardiovascular benefits.

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch13_s02_s01_s03_p07">Be wary of quoting from sources at length. Remember, your ideas should drive the paper, and quotations should be used to support and enhance your points. Make sure any lengthy quotations that you include serve a clear purpose. Generally, no more than 10–15 percent of a paper should consist of quoted material.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p01">Including an introductory phrase in your text, such as “Jackson wrote” or “Copeland found,” often helps you integrate source material smoothly. This citation technique also helps convey that you are actively engaged with your source material. Unfortunately, during the process of writing your research paper, it is easy to fall into a rut and use the same few dull verbs repeatedly, such as “Jones said,” “Smith stated,” and so on.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s02_s01_s04_p02">Punch up your writing by using strong verbs that help your reader understand how the source material presents ideas. There is a world of difference between an author who “suggests” and one who “claims,” one who “questions” and one who “criticizes.” You do not need to consult your thesaurus every time you cite a source, but do think about which verbs will accurately represent the ideas and make your writing more engaging. The following chart shows some possibilities.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">MLA style</a><span class="glossdef">Modern Language Association style, or MLA, is often used in the liberal arts and humanities.

It also provides the framework for the works cited area for listing references at the end of the essay.</span></span> is often used in the liberal arts and humanities. Like APA style, it provides a uniform framework for consistency across a document in several areas. MLA style provides a format for the manuscript text and parenthetical citations, or in-text citations. It also provides the framework for the works cited area for references at the end of the essay. MLA style emphasizes brevity and clarity. As a student writer, it is to your advantage to be familiar with both major styles, and this section will outline the main points of MLA as well as offer specific examples of commonly used references. Remember that your writing represents you in your absence. The correct use of a citation style demonstrates your attention to detail and ability to produce a scholarly work in an acceptable style, and it can help prevent the appearance or accusations of plagiarism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p03">If you are taking an English, art history, or music appreciation class, chances are that you will be asked to write an essay in MLA format. One common question goes something like “What’s the difference?” referring to APA and MLA style, and it deserves our consideration. The liberal arts and humanities often reflect works of creativity that come from individual and group effort, but they may adapt, change, or build on previous creative works. The inspiration to create something new, from a song to a music video, may contain elements of previous works. Drawing on your fellow artists and authors is part of the creative process, and so is giving credit where credit is due.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p04">A reader interested in your subject wants not only to read what you wrote but also to be aware of the works that you used to create it. Readers want to examine your sources to see if you know your subject, to see if you missed anything, or if you offer anything new and interesting. Your new or up-to-date sources may offer the reader additional insight on the subject being considered. It also demonstrates that you, as the author, are up-to-date on what is happening in the field or on the subject. Giving credit where it is due enhances your credibility, and the MLA style offers a clear format to use.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p05">Uncredited work that is incorporated into your own writing is considered plagiarism. In the professional world, plagiarism results in loss of credibility and often compensation, including future opportunities. In a classroom setting, plagiarism results in a range of sanctions, from loss of a grade to expulsion from a school or university. In both professional and academic settings, the penalties are severe. MLA offers artists and authors a systematic style of reference, again giving credit where credit is due, to protect MLA users from accusations of plagiarism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p06">MLA style uses a citation in the body of the essay that links to the works cited page at the end. The in-text citation is offset with parentheses, clearly calling attention to itself for the reader. The reference to the author or title is like a signal to the reader that information was incorporated from a separate source. It also provides the reader with information to then turn to the works cited section of your essay (at the end) where they can find the complete reference. If you follow the MLA style, and indicate your source both in your essay and in the works cited section, you will prevent the possibility of plagiarism. If you follow the MLA guidelines, pay attention to detail, and clearly indicate your sources, then this approach to formatting and citation offers a proven way to demonstrate your respect for other authors and artists.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Five Reasons to Use MLA Style</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fresh-ch13_s04_l02">
            <li>To demonstrate your ability to present a professional, academic essay in the correct style</li>
            <li>To gain credibility and authenticity for your work</li>
            <li>To enhance the ability of the reader to locate information discussed in your essay</li>
            <li>To give credit where credit is due and prevent plagiarism</li>
            <li>To get a good grade or demonstrate excellence in your writing</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p07">Before we transition to specifics, please consider one word of caution: consistency. If you are instructed to use the MLA style and need to indicate a date, you have options. For example, you could use an international or a US style:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_l03">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">International style:</strong> 18 May 1980 (day/month/year)</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">US style:</strong> May 18, 1980 (month/day/year)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p08">If you are going to the US style, be consistent in its use. You’ll find you have the option on page 83 of the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers</em>, 7th edition. You have many options when writing in English as the language itself has several conventions, or acceptable ways of writing particular parts of speech or information. For example, on the next page our <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> addresses the question:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p09">Which convention is preferred in MLA style:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable" id="fresh-ch13_s04_l04">
            <li>twentieth century</li>
            <li>Twentieth Century</li>
            <li>20th century</li>
            <li>20th Century</li>
        </ol>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p10">You are welcome to look in the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> and see there is one preferred style or convention (you will also find the answer at end of this section marked by an asterisk [*]). Now you may say to yourself that you won’t write that term and it may be true, but you will come to a term or word that has more than one way it can be written. In that case, what convention is acceptable in MLA style? This is where the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> serves as an invaluable resource. Again, your attention to detail and the professional presentation of your work are aspects of learning to write in an academic setting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_p11">Now let’s transition from a general discussion on the advantages of MLA style to what we are required to do to write a standard academic essay. We will first examine a general “to do” list, then review a few “do not” suggestions, and finally take a tour through a sample of MLA features.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s02_p01">You never get a second chance to make a first impression, and your title block (not a separate title page; just a section at the top of the first page) makes an impression on the reader. If correctly formatted with each element of information in its proper place, form, and format, it says to the reader that you mean business, that you are a professional, and that you take your work seriously, so it should, in turn, be seriously considered. Your title block in MLA style contributes to your credibility. Remember that your writing represents you in your absence, and the title block is the tailored suit or outfit that represents you best. That said, sometimes a separate title page is necessary, but it is best both to know how to properly format a title block or page in MLA style and to ask your instructor if it is included as part of the assignment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s05_p01">You must cite your sources as you use them. In the same way that a table or figure should be located right next to the sentence that discusses it (see the previous example), parenthetical citations, or citations enclosed in parenthesis that appear in the text, are required. You need to cite all your information. If someone else wrote it, said it, drew it, demonstrated it, or otherwise expressed it, you need to cite it. The exception to this statement is common, widespread knowledge. For example, if you search online for MLA resources, and specifically MLA sample papers, you will find many similar discussions on MLA style. MLA is a style and cannot be copyrighted because it is a style, but the seventh edition of the <em class="emphasis">MLA Handbook</em> can be copyright protected. If you reference a specific page in that handbook, you need to indicate it. If you write about a general MLA style issue that is commonly covered or addressed in multiple sources, you do not. When in doubt, reference the specific resource you used to write your essay.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch13_s04_s05_p02">Your in-text, or parenthetical, citations should do the following:</p>
