The more you sort through the pieces of information you found, the more you will begin to see the connections between them. Patterns and gaps may begin to stand out. But only when you start to organize your ideas will you be able to translate your raw insights into a form that will communicate meaning to your audience.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s02_p02">Longer papers require more reading and planning than shorter papers do. Most writers discover that the more they know about a topic, the more they can write about it with intelligence and interest.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizing Ideas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_p01">When you write, you need to organize your ideas in an order that makes sense. The writing you complete in all your courses exposes how analytically and critically your mind works. In some courses, the only direct contact you may have with your instructor is through the assignments you write for the course. You can make a good impression by spending time ordering your ideas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_p02">Order refers to your choice of what to present first, second, third, and so on in your writing. The order you pick closely relates to your purpose for writing that particular assignment. For example, when telling a story, it may be important to first describe the background for the action. Or you may need to first describe a 3-D movie projector or a television studio to help readers visualize the setting and scene. You may want to group your support effectively to convince readers that your point of view on an issue is well reasoned and worthy of belief.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_p03">In longer pieces of writing, you may organize different parts in different ways so that your purpose stands out clearly and all parts of the paper work together to consistently develop your main point.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Methods of Organizing Writing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p01">The three common methods of organizing writing are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chronological order</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to time.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spatial order</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to physical characteristics or appearance.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">order of importance</a><span class="glossdef">A method of organization that arranges ideas according to their significance.</span></span>. You will learn more about these in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a>; however, you need to keep these methods of organization in mind as you plan how to arrange the information you have gathered in an outline. An outline is a written plan that serves as a skeleton for the paragraphs you write. Later, when you draft paragraphs in the next stage of the writing process, you will add support to create “flesh” and “muscle” for your assignment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s01_s01_p02">When you write, your goal is not only to complete an assignment but also to write for a specific purpose—perhaps to inform, to explain, to persuade, or for a combination of these purposes. Your purpose for writing should always be in the back of your mind, because it will help you decide which pieces of information belong together and how you will order them. In other words, choose the order that will most effectively fit your purpose and support your main point.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing a Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s02_p01">One legitimate question readers always ask about a piece of writing is “What is the big idea?” (You may even ask this question when you are the reader, critically reading an assignment or another document.) Every nonfiction writing task—from the short essay to the ten-page term paper to the lengthy senior thesis—needs a big idea, or a controlling idea, as the spine for the work. The controlling idea is the main idea that you want to present and develop.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s02_p02">For a longer piece of writing, the main idea should be broader than the main idea for a shorter piece of writing. Be sure to frame a main idea that is appropriate for the length of the assignment. Ask yourself, “How many pages will it take for me to explain and explore this main idea in detail?” Be reasonable with your estimate. Then expand or trim it to fit the required length.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s02_p03">The big idea, or controlling idea, you want to present in an essay is expressed in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">thesis statement</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the controlling idea of an essay.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s03_p01">For an essay question on a test or a brief oral presentation in class, all you may need to prepare is a short, informal outline in which you jot down key ideas in the order you will present them. This kind of outline reminds you to stay focused in a stressful situation and to include all the good ideas that help you explain or prove your point.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s03_p02">For a longer assignment, like an essay or a research paper, many college instructors require students to submit a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">formal outline</a><span class="glossdef">A detailed guide that shows how all the supporting ideas in an essay are related to one other.</span></span> before writing a major paper as a way to be sure you are on the right track and are working in an organized manner.

Words and phrases keep the outline short and easier to comprehend. All the headings, however, must be written in parallel structure. (For more information on parallel structure, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch07#fresh-ch07">Chapter 7 "Refining Your Writing: How Do I Improve My Writing Technique?"</a>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s03_s01_p02">Here is the topic outline that Mariah constructed for the essay she is developing. Her purpose is to inform, and her audience is a general audience of her fellow college students. Notice how Mariah begins with her thesis statement. She then arranges her main points and supporting details in outline form using short phrases in parallel grammatical structure.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s03_s01_p04">Word processing programs generally have an automatic numbering feature that can be used to prepare outlines. This feature automatically sets indents and lets you use the tab key to arrange information just as you would in an outline. Although in business this style might be acceptable, in college your instructor might have different requirements. Teach yourself how to customize the levels of outline numbering in your word-processing program to fit your instructor’s preferences.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch08_s02_s03_s02_p03">The information compiled under each roman numeral will become a paragraph in your final paper. In the previous example, the outline follows the standard five-paragraph essay arrangement, but longer essays will require more paragraphs and thus more roman numerals. If you think that a paragraph might become too long or stringy, add an additional paragraph to your outline, renumbering the main points appropriately.</p>

                    <li>Writers must put their ideas in order so the assignment makes sense. The most common orders are chronological order, spatial order, and order of importance.</li>
