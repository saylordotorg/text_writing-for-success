    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_p01">Imagine you are reading a book for school. You need to find important details that you can use for an assignment. However, when you begin to read, you notice that the book has very little punctuation. Sentences fail to form complete paragraphs and instead form one block of text without clear organization. Most likely, this book would frustrate and confuse you. Without clear and concise sentences, it is difficult to find the information you need.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_p02">For both students and professionals, clear communication is important. Whether you are typing an e-mail or writing a report, it is your responsibility to present your thoughts and ideas clearly and precisely. Writing in complete sentences is one way to ensure that you communicate well. This section covers how to recognize and write basic sentence structures and how to avoid some common writing errors.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Components of a Sentence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s01_p01">Clearly written, complete sentences require key information: a subject, a verb and a complete idea. A sentence needs to make sense on its own. Sometimes, complete sentences are also called independent clauses. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">clause</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that contains a subject and a verb and may make up a complete sentence.</span></span> is a group of words that may make up a sentence. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">independent clause</a><span class="glossdef">A group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete, grammatically correct thought. An independent clause is a complete sentence.</span></span> is a group of words that may stand alone as a complete, grammatically correct thought. The following sentences show independent clauses.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s01_p02">All complete sentences have at least one independent clause. You can identify an independent clause by reading it on its own and looking for the subject and the verb.</p>

A noun is a word that identifies a person, place, thing, or idea. A pronoun is a word that replaces a noun.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s02_s02_s01_p01">Fragments often occur because of some common error, such as starting a sentence with a preposition, a dependent word, an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">infinitive</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form that combines the word <em class="emphasis">to</em> with a verb, such as <em class="emphasis">to buy</em>, <em class="emphasis">to go</em>, or <em class="emphasis">to gather</em>.</span></span>, or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gerund</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form ending in -<em class="emphasis">ing</em> that is used as a noun, such as <em class="emphasis">running</em>, <em class="emphasis">writing</em>, or <em class="emphasis">celebrating</em>.</span></span>. If you use the six basic sentence patterns when you write, you should be able to avoid these errors and thus avoid writing fragments.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s02_s02_s01_p02">When you see a preposition, check to see that it is part of a sentence containing a subject and a verb. If it is not connected to a complete sentence, it is a fragment, and you will need to fix this type of fragment by combining it with another sentence. You can add the prepositional phrase to the end of the sentence. If you add it to the beginning of the other sentence, insert a comma after the prepositional phrase.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch02_s01_s02_s03_s02_p01">You can also fix run-on sentences by adding a comma and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coordinating conjunction</a><span class="glossdef">A word that links two independent clauses. Common coordinating conjunctions are <em class="emphasis">for</em>, <em class="emphasis">and</em>, <em class="emphasis">nor</em>, <em class="emphasis">but</em>, <em class="emphasis">or</em>, <em class="emphasis">yet</em>, and <em class="emphasis">so</em>.</span></span>.

The e-mail ends with another fragment. What effect would this e-mail have on Mr. Blankenship or other readers? Mr. Blankenship or other readers may not think highly of Isaebelle’s communication skills or—worse—may not understand the message at all! Communications written in precise, complete sentences are not only more professional but also easier to understand. Before you hit the “send” button, read your e-mail carefully to make sure that the sentences are complete, are not run together, and are correctly punctuated.</p>

                        <li>The report is due on Wednesday but we’re flying back from Miami that morning. I told the project manager that we would be able to get the report to her later that day she suggested that we come back a day early to get the report done and I told her we had meetings until our flight took off. We e-mailed our contact who said that they would check with his boss, she said that the project could afford a delay as long as they wouldn’t have to make any edits or changes to the file our new deadline is next Friday.</li>
                        <li>Anna tried getting a reservation at the restaurant, but when she called they said that there was a waiting list so she put our names down on the list when the day of our reservation arrived we only had to wait thirty minutes because a table opened up unexpectedly which was good because we were able to catch a movie after dinner in the time we’d expected to wait to be seated.</li>
                        <li>Without a doubt, my favorite artist is Leonardo da Vinci, not because of his paintings but because of his fascinating designs, models, and sketches, including plans for scuba gear, a flying machine, and a life-size mechanical lion that actually walked and moved its head. His paintings are beautiful too, especially when you see the computer enhanced versions researchers use a variety of methods to discover and enhance the paintings’ original colors, the result of which are stunningly vibrant and yet delicate displays of the man’s genius.</li>

                        <li>A sentence is complete when it contains both a subject and verb. A complete sentence makes sense on its own.</li>
                        <li>Every sentence must have a subject, which usually appears at the beginning of the sentence. A subject may be a noun (a person, place, or thing) or a pronoun.</li>
                        <li>A compound subject contains more than one noun.</li>
                        <li>A prepositional phrase describes, or modifies, another word in the sentence but cannot be the subject of a sentence.</li>
                        <li>A verb is often an action word that indicates what the subject is doing. Verbs may be action verbs, linking verbs, or helping verbs.</li>
                        <li>Variety in sentence structure and length improves writing by making it more interesting and more complex.</li>
                        <li>Focusing on the six basic sentence patterns will enhance your writing.</li>
                        <li>Fragments and run-on sentences are two common errors in sentence construction.</li>
                        <li>Fragments can be corrected by adding a missing subject or verb. Fragments that begin with a preposition or a dependent word can be corrected by combining the fragment with another sentence.</li>
                        <li>Run-on sentences can be corrected by adding appropriate punctuation or adding a coordinating conjunction.</li>
