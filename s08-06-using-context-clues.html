    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Context clues</a><span class="glossdef">Words or phrases in a text that help clarify the meaning of an unfamiliar word.</span></span> are bits of information within a text that will assist you in deciphering the meaning of unknown words. Since most of your knowledge of vocabulary comes from reading, it is important that you recognize context clues. By becoming more aware of particular words and phrases surrounding a difficult word, you can make logical guesses about its meaning. The following are the different types of context clues:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_l02">
        <li>Brief definition or restatement</li>
        <li>Synonyms and antonyms</li>
        <li>Examples</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Brief Definition or Restatement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p01">Sometimes a text directly states the definition or a restatement of the unknown word. The brief definition or restatement is signaled by a word or a punctuation mark. Consider the following example:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p02">If you visit Alaska, you will likely see many glaciers, or slow moving masses of ice.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p03">In this sentence, the word <em class="emphasis">glaciers</em> is defined by the phrase that follows the signal word <em class="emphasis">or</em>, which is <em class="emphasis">slow moving masses of ice</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p04">In other instances, the text may restate the meaning of the word in a different way, by using punctuation as a signal. Look at the following example:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p05">Marina was indignant—fuming mad—when she discovered her brother had left for the party without her.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s01_p06">Although <em class="emphasis">fuming mad</em> is not a formal definition of the word <em class="emphasis">indignant</em>, it does serve to define it. These two examples use signals—the word <em class="emphasis">or</em> and the punctuation dashes—to indicate the meaning of the unfamiliar word. Other signals to look for are the words <em class="emphasis">is</em>, <em class="emphasis">as</em>, <em class="emphasis">means</em>, <em class="emphasis">known as</em>, and <em class="emphasis">refers to</em>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Synonyms and Antonyms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p01">Sometimes a text gives a synonym of the unknown word to signal the meaning of the unfamiliar word:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p02">When you interpret an image, you actively question and examine what the image connotes and suggests.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p03">In this sentence the word <em class="emphasis">suggests</em> is a synonym of the word <em class="emphasis">connotes</em>. The word <em class="emphasis">and</em> sometimes signals synonyms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p04">Likewise, the word <em class="emphasis">but</em> may signal a contrast, which can help you define a word by its antonym.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_n02">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p05">I abhor clothes shopping, but I adore grocery shopping.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s02_p06">The word <em class="emphasis">abhor</em> is contrasted with its opposite: <em class="emphasis">adore</em>. From this context, the reader can guess that <em class="emphasis">abhor</em> means to dislike greatly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Examples</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p01">Sometimes a text will give you an example of the word that sheds light on its meaning:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p02">I knew Mark’s ailurophobia was in full force because he began trembling and stuttering when he saw my cat, Ludwig, slink out from under the bed.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p03">Although <em class="emphasis">ailurophobia</em> is an unknown word, the sentence gives an example of its effects. Based on this example, a reader could confidently surmise that the word means a fear of cats.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p04">Look for signal words like <em class="emphasis">such as</em>, <em class="emphasis">for instance</em>, and <em class="emphasis">for example</em>. These words signal that a word’s meaning may be revealed through an example.</p>

Little Maggie never <span class="token">gloated</span> or took pride in her paintings; she just smiled contentedly when she finished one and requested her parents give it to someone as a gift.

            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p10">Jargon a type of shorthand communication often used in the workplace. It is the technical language of a special field. Imagine it is your first time working as a server in a restaurant and your manager tells you he is going to “eighty-six” the roasted chicken. If you do not realize that “eighty-six” means to remove an item from the menu, you could be confused.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s06_s03_p11">When you first start a job, no matter where it may be, you will encounter jargon that will likely be foreign to you. Perhaps after working the job for a short time, you too will feel comfortable enough to use it. When you are first hired, however, jargon can be baffling and make you feel like an outsider. If you cannot decipher the jargon based on the context, it is always a good policy to ask.</p>
