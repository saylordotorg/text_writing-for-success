    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_p01">Now that you have identified common purposes for writing and learned how to select appropriate content for a particular audience, you can think about the structure of a paragraph in greater detail. Composing an effective paragraph requires a method similar to building a house. You may have the finest content, or materials, but if you do not arrange them in the correct order, then the final product will not hold together very well.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_p02">A strong paragraph contains three distinct components:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_l02">
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">The sentence in a paragraph that controls the point of the paragraph. A topic sentence is most often located at the beginning of a paragraph, and it makes the structure of a text and the writer’s basic arguments easy to locate and comprehend.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> The topic sentence is the main idea of the paragraph.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Body</a><span class="glossdef">The middle part of a paragraph containing supporting sentences. The body of the paragraph provides additional information about the topic sentence.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> The body is composed of the supporting sentences that develop the main point.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conclusion</a><span class="glossdef">The final sentence in a paragraph that summarizes the main point.</span></span><strong class="emphasis bold">.</strong> The conclusion is the final sentence that summarizes the main point.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_p03">The foundation of a good paragraph is the topic sentence, which expresses the main idea of the paragraph. The topic sentence relates to the thesis, or main point, of the essay (see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch09#fresh-ch09">Chapter 9 "Writing Essays: From Start to Finish"</a> for more information about thesis statements) and guides the reader by signposting what the paragraph is about. All the sentences in the rest of the paragraph should relate to the topic sentence.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_p04">This section covers the major components of a paragraph and examines how to develop an effective topic sentence.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Developing a Topic Sentence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p01">Pick up any newspaper or magazine and read the first sentence of an article. Are you fairly confident that you know what the rest of the article is about? If so, you have likely read the topic sentence. An effective topic sentence combines a main idea with the writer’s personal attitude or opinion. It serves to orient the reader and provides an indication of what will follow in the rest of the paragraph. Read the following example.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p02">Creating a national set of standards for math and English education will improve student learning in many states.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p03">This topic sentence declares a favorable position for standardizing math and English education. After reading this sentence, a reader might reasonably expect the writer to provide supporting details and facts as to why standardizing math and English education might improve student learning in many states. If the purpose of the essay is actually to evaluate education in only one particular state, or to discuss math or English education specifically, then the topic sentence is misleading.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_n02">
            <h3 class="title">Tip</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_p04">When writing a draft of an essay, allow a friend or colleague to read the opening line of your first paragraph. Ask your reader to predict what your paper will be about. If he or she is unable to guess your topic accurately, you should consider revising your topic sentence so that it clearly defines your purpose in writing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Main Idea versus Controlling Idea</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p01">Topic sentences contain both a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">main idea</a><span class="glossdef">The topic discussed throughout the paragraph.</span></span> (the subject, or topic that the writer is discussing) and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">controlling idea</a><span class="glossdef">Indicates the writer’s stance on the main idea of a paragraph. The controlling idea appears in the paragraph’s topic sentence.</span></span> (the writer’s specific stance on that subject). Just as a thesis statement includes an idea that controls a document’s focus (as you will read about in <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>), a topic sentence must also contain a controlling idea to direct the paragraph. Different writers may use the same main idea but can steer their paragraph in a number of different directions according to their stance on the subject. Read the following examples.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01_n01">
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>Marijuana is a destructive influence on teens and causes long-term brain damage.</li>
                    <li>The antinausea properties in marijuana are a lifeline for many cancer patients.</li>
                    <li>Legalizing marijuana would create a higher demand for Class A and Class B drugs.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s01_p02">Although the main idea—marijuana—is the same in all three topic sentences, the controlling idea differs depending on the writer’s viewpoint.</p>

These obstacles make it difficult for the reader to follow.)</p>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p22">When creating a workplace document, use the “top-down” approach—keep the topic sentence at the beginning of each paragraph so that readers immediately understand the gist of the message. This method saves busy colleagues precious time and effort trying to figure out the main points and relevant details.</p>
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s01_s02_p23">Headings are another helpful tool. In a text-heavy document, break up each paragraph with individual headings. These serve as useful navigation aids, enabling colleagues to skim through the document and locate paragraphs that are relevant to them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_p01">Learning how to develop a good topic sentence is the first step toward writing a solid paragraph. Once you have composed your topic sentence, you have a guideline for the rest of the paragraph. To complete the paragraph, a writer must support the topic sentence with additional information and summarize the main point with a concluding sentence.</p>

Most academic essays contain the topic sentence at the beginning of the first paragraph.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p07">Now take a look at the following paragraph. The topic sentence is underlined for you.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_n02">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p08">Last year, a cat traveled 130 miles to reach its family, who had moved to another state and had left their pet behind. Even though it had never been to their new home, the cat was able to track down its former owners. A dog in my neighborhood can predict when its master is about to have a seizure. It makes sure that he does not hurt himself during an epileptic fit. <span class="token">Compared to many animals, our own senses are almost dull.</span></p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p09">The last sentence of this paragraph is the topic sentence. It draws on specific examples (a cat that tracked down its owners and a dog that can predict seizures) and then makes a general statement that draws a conclusion from these examples (animals’ senses are better than humans’). In this case, the supporting sentences are placed before the topic sentence and the concluding sentence is the same as the topic sentence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p10">This technique is frequently used in persuasive writing. The writer produces detailed examples as evidence to back up his or her point, preparing the reader to accept the concluding topic sentence as the truth.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p11">Sometimes, the topic sentence appears in the middle of a paragraph. Read the following example. The topic sentence is underlined for you.</p>
            <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_n03">
                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p12">For many years, I suffered from severe anxiety every time I took an exam. Hours before the exam, my heart would begin pounding, my legs would shake, and sometimes I would become physically unable to move. <span class="token">Last year, I was referred to a specialist and finally found a way to control my anxiety—breathing exercises.</span> It seems so simple, but by doing just a few breathing exercises a couple of hours before an exam, I gradually got my anxiety under control. The exercises help slow my heart rate and make me feel less anxious. Better yet, they require no pills, no equipment, and very little time. It’s amazing how just breathing correctly has helped me learn to manage my anxiety symptoms.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p13">In this paragraph, the underlined sentence is the topic sentence. It expresses the main idea—that breathing exercises can help control anxiety. The preceding sentences enable the writer to build up to his main point (breathing exercises can help control anxiety) by using a personal anecdote (how he used to suffer from anxiety). The supporting sentences then expand on how breathing exercises help the writer by providing additional information. The last sentence is the concluding sentence and restates how breathing can help manage anxiety.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_p14">Placing a topic sentence in the middle of a paragraph is often used in creative writing. If you notice that you have used a topic sentence in the middle of a paragraph in an academic essay, read through the paragraph carefully to make sure that it contains only one major topic.

                <h2 class="title editable block">Implied Topic Sentences</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p01">Some well-organized paragraphs do not contain a topic sentence at all. Instead of being directly stated, the main idea is implied in the content of the paragraph. Read the following example:</p>
                <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_n01">
                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p02">Heaving herself up the stairs, Luella had to pause for breath several times. She let out a wheeze as she sat down heavily in the wooden rocking chair. Tao approached her cautiously, as if she might crumble at the slightest touch. He studied her face, like parchment; stretched across the bones so finely he could almost see right through the skin to the decaying muscle underneath. Luella smiled a toothless grin.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p03">Although no single sentence in this paragraph states the main idea, the entire paragraph focuses on one concept—that Luella is extremely old. The topic sentence is thus implied rather than stated. This technique is often used in descriptive or narrative writing. Implied topic sentences work well if the writer has a firm idea of what he or she intends to say in the paragraph and sticks to it. However, a paragraph loses its effectiveness if an implied topic sentence is too subtle or the writer loses focus.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s01_p04">Avoid using implied topic sentences in an informational document. Readers often lose patience if they are unable to quickly grasp what the writer is trying to say. The clearest and most efficient way to communicate in an informational document is to position the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph.</p>

Of these hardy creatures, the kangaroo rat is possibly the most fascinating. Able to live in some of the most arid parts of the southwest, the kangaroo rat neither sweats nor pants to keep cool. Its specialized kidneys enable it to survive on a miniscule amount of water. Unlike other desert creatures, the kangaroo rat does not store water in its body but instead is able to convert the dry seeds it eats into moisture. Its ability to adapt to such a hostile environment makes the kangaroo rat a truly amazing creature.</p>

They make up the body of the paragraph by explaining, proving, or enhancing the controlling idea in the topic sentence. Most paragraphs contain three to six supporting sentences depending on the audience and purpose for writing. A supporting sentence usually offers one of the following:</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p01">An effective concluding sentence draws together all the ideas you have raised in your paragraph. It reminds readers of the main point—the topic sentence—without restating it in exactly the same words. Using the hamburger example, the top bun (the topic sentence) and the bottom bun (the concluding sentence) are very similar. They frame the “meat” or body of the paragraph. Compare the topic sentence and concluding sentence from the previous example:</p>

The concluding sentence reiterates the idea that owning a hybrid is advantageous without using the exact same words.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s03_p05">You should avoid introducing any new ideas into your concluding sentence.

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transition</a><span class="glossdef">Words and phrases that show how the ideas in sentences and paragraphs are related.</span></span> is a connecting word that describes a relationship between ideas.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch06_s02_s02_s01_s04_p04">The transition word <em class="emphasis">because</em> is a transition word of consequence that continues a line of thought.

                        <li>The topic sentence expresses the main idea of the paragraph combined with the writer’s attitude or opinion about the topic.</li>
                        <li>Good topic sentences contain both a main idea and a controlling idea, are clear and easy to follow, use engaging vocabulary, and provide an accurate indication of what will follow in the rest of the paragraph.</li>
