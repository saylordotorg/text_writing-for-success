            <li>Identify the reasons why using a dictionary and thesaurus is important when writing.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_p01">Effective writing involves making conscious choices with words. When you prepare to sit down to write your first draft, you likely have already completed some freewriting exercises, chosen your topic, developed your thesis statement, written an outline, and even selected your sources. When it is time to write your first draft, start to consider which words to use to best convey your ideas to the reader.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_p02">Some writers are picky about word choice as they start drafting. They may practice some specific strategies, such as using a dictionary and thesaurus, using words and phrases with proper connotations, and avoiding slang, clichés, and overly general words.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_p03">Once you understand these tricks of the trade, you can move ahead confidently in writing your assignment. Remember, the skill and accuracy of your word choice is a major factor in developing your writing style. Precise selection of your words will help you be more clearly understood—in both writing and speaking.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using a Dictionary and Thesaurus</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p01">Even professional writers need help with the meanings, spellings, pronunciations, and uses of particular words. In fact, they rely on dictionaries to help them write better. No one knows every word in the English language and their multiple uses and meanings, so all writers, from novices to professionals, can benefit from the use of dictionaries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p02">Most dictionaries provide the following information:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Spelling.</strong> How the word and its different forms are spelled.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pronunciation.</strong> How to say the word.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Part of speech.</strong> The function of the word.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Definition.</strong> The meaning of the word.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Synonyms.</strong> Words that have similar meanings.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Etymology.</strong> The history of the word.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p03">Look at the following sample dictionary entry and see which of the preceeding information you can identify:</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_n01">
            <p class="para" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">myth</strong>, mith, <em class="emphasis">n.</em> [Gr. <em class="emphasis">mythos</em>, a word, a fable, a legend.] A fable or legend embodying the convictions of a people as to their gods or other divine beings, their own beginnings and early history and the heroes connected with it, or the origin of the world; any invented story; something or someone having no existence in fact.—<strong class="emphasis bold">myth • ic</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">myth • i • cal</strong></p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch04_s03_s01_p05">Like a dictionary, a thesaurus is another indispensable writing tool. A thesaurus gives you a list of synonyms, words that have the same (or very close to the same) meaning as another word. It also lists antonyms, words with the opposite meaning of the word. A thesaurus will help you when you are looking for the perfect word with just the right meaning to convey your ideas. It will also help you learn more words and use the ones you already know more correctly.</p>
