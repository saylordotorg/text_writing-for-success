That is understandable—but leave yourself with enough time to complete this important stage of the writing process. In this section, you will learn the following specific strategies that are useful for revising and editing a research paper:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_p01">When writing a research paper, it is easy to become overly focused on editorial details, such as the proper format for bibliographical entries. These details do matter. However, before you begin to address them, it is important to spend time reviewing and revising the content of the paper.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_p02">A good research paper is both organized and cohesive. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Organization</a><span class="glossdef">In writing, a quality that describes the paper proceeding logically from the introduction to the body paragraphs to the conclusion.</span></span> means that your argument flows logically from one point to the next. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cohesion</a><span class="glossdef">In writing, a quality that describes the elements of a paper working together smoothly and naturally.</span></span> means that the elements of your paper work together smoothly and naturally.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p04">Jorge reread his draft paragraph by paragraph. As he read, he highlighted the main idea of each paragraph so he could see whether his ideas proceeded in a logical order. For the most part, the flow of ideas was clear. However, he did notice that one paragraph did not have a clear main idea. It interrupted the flow of the writing. During revision, Jorge added a topic sentence that clearly connected the paragraph to the one that had preceded it. He also added transitions to improve the flow of ideas from sentence to sentence.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p05">Read the following paragraphs twice, the first time without Jorge’s changes, and the second time with them.</p>

                    <li>Next, reread your paper more slowly, looking for how ideas flow from sentence to sentence. Identify places where adding a transition or recasting a sentence would make the ideas flow more logically.</li>

                <p class="para" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p08">Writers choose transitions carefully to show the relationships between ideas—for instance, to make a comparison or elaborate on a point with examples. Make sure your transitions suit your purpose and avoid overusing the same ones. For an extensive list of transitions, see <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08#fresh-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Writing Process: How Do I Begin?"</a>, <a class="xref" href="fresh-ch08_s04#fresh-ch08_s04">Section 8.4 "Revising and Editing"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p01">When you revise to improve cohesion, you analyze how the parts of your paper work together. You look for anything that seems awkward or out of place. Revision may involve deleting unnecessary material or rewriting parts of the paper so that the out-of-place material fits in smoothly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p02">In a research paper, problems with cohesion usually occur when a writer has trouble integrating source material. If facts or quotations have been awkwardly dropped into a paragraph, they distract or confuse the reader instead of working to support the writer’s point. Overusing paraphrased and quoted material has the same effect. Use Checklist 12.2 to review your essay for cohesion.</p>

He also realized that the quotation at the end of the paragraph was awkward and ineffective. How would his readers know who Kwon was or why her opinion should be taken seriously? Adding an introductory phrase helped Jorge integrate this quotation smoothly and establish the credibility of his source.</p>

Speakers sometimes rely on cute graphics or funny quotations to hold their audience’s attention. If you choose to use these elements, make sure they work well with the substantive content of your presentation. For example, if you are asked to give a financial presentation, and the financial report shows that the company lost money, funny illustrations would not be relevant or appropriate for the presentation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using a Consistent Style and Tone</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Once you are certain that the content of your paper fulfills your purpose, you can begin revising to improve <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">style</a><span class="glossdef">The unique way a writer uses language, which encompasses choices about sentence structure and word selection.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tone</a><span class="glossdef">In writing, the attitude a writer conveys toward the subject and the audience.</span></span>. Together, your style and tone create the voice of your paper, or how you come across to readers. Style refers to the way you use language as a writer—the sentence structures you use and the word choices you make. Tone is the attitude toward your subject and audience that you convey through your word choice.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Determining an Appropriate Style and Tone</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01_p01">Although accepted writing styles will vary within different disciplines, the underlying goal is the same—to come across to your readers as a knowledgeable, authoritative guide. Writing about research is like being a tour guide who walks readers through a topic. A stuffy, overly formal tour guide can make readers feel put off or intimidated. Too much informality or humor can make readers wonder whether the tour guide really knows what he or she is talking about. Extreme or emotionally charged language comes across as unbalanced.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01_p02">To help prevent being overly formal or informal, determine an appropriate style and tone at the beginning of the research process. Consider your topic and audience because these can help dictate style and tone. For example, a paper on new breakthroughs in cancer research should be more formal than a paper on ways to get a good night’s sleep.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s01_p03">A strong research paper comes across as straightforward, appropriately academic, and serious. It is generally best to avoid writing in the first person, as this can make your paper seem overly subjective and opinion based. Use Checklist 12.3 on style to review your paper for other issues that affect style and tone. You can check for consistency at the end of the writing process. Checking for consistency is discussed later in this section.</p>

It is best to reread for style after you have completed the other revisions so that you are not distracted by any larger content issues. Revising strategies you can use include the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read your paper aloud.</strong> Sometimes your ears catch inconsistencies that your eyes miss.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Share your paper with another reader whom you trust to give you honest feedback.</strong> It is often difficult to evaluate one’s own style objectively—especially in the final phase of a challenging writing project. Another reader may be more likely to notice instances of wordiness, confusing language, or other issues that affect style and tone.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Line-edit your paper slowly, sentence by sentence.</strong> You may even wish to use a sheet of paper to cover everything on the page except the paragraph you are editing—that forces you to read slowly and carefully. Mark any areas where you notice problems in style or tone, and then take time to rework those sections.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s02_s02_p02">On reviewing his paper, Jorge found that he had generally used an appropriately academic style and tone. However, he noticed one glaring exception—his first paragraph. He realized there were places where his overly informal writing could come across as unserious or, worse, disparaging. Revising his word choice and omitting a humorous aside helped Jorge maintain a consistent tone. Read his revisions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s03_p01">After revising your paper to address problems in content or style, you will complete one final editorial review. Perhaps you already have caught and corrected minor mistakes during previous revisions. Nevertheless, give your draft a final edit to make sure it is error-free. Your final edit should focus on two broad areas:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s03_l01">

Using the spell-checking feature in your word-processing program can be helpful—but this should not replace a full, careful review of your document. Be sure to check for any errors that may have come up frequently for you in the past. Use Checklist 12.4 to help you as you edit:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fresh-ch12_s02_s03_s02_p01">When editing a research paper, it is also important to check that you have cited sources properly and formatted your document according to the specified guidelines. There are two reasons for this. First and foremost, citing sources correctly ensures that you have given proper credit to other people for ideas and information that helped you in your work. Second, using correct formatting establishes your paper as one student’s contribution to the work developed by and for a larger academic community. Increasingly, American Psychological Association (APA) style guidelines are the standard for many academic fields. Modern Language Association (MLA) is also a standard style in many fields. Use Checklist 12.5 to help you check citations and formatting.</p>
