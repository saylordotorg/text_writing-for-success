Your outfit or suit says something about you when meeting face-to-face, and your writing represents you in your absence. Grammatical mistakes in your writing or even in speaking make a negative impression on coworkers, clients, and potential employers. Subject-verb agreement is one of the most common errors that people make. Having a solid understanding of this concept is critical when making a good impression, and it will help ensure that your ideas are communicated clearly.</p>

                        <li>Parts of sentences must agree in number, person, case, and gender.</li>
                        <li>A verb must always agree with its subject in number. A singular subject requires a singular verb; a plural subject requires a plural verb.</li>
                        <li>Irregular verbs do not follow a predictable pattern in their singular and plural forms. Common irregular verbs are <em class="emphasis">to be</em>, <em class="emphasis">to have</em>, and <em class="emphasis">to do</em>.</li>
                        <li>A compound subject is formed when two or more nouns are joined by the words <em class="emphasis">and</em>, <em class="emphasis">or</em>, or <em class="emphasis">nor</em>.</li>
                        <li>In some sentences, the subject and verb may be separated by a phrase or clause, but the verb must still agree with the subject.</li>
                        <li>Indefinite pronouns, such as <em class="emphasis">anyone</em>, <em class="emphasis">each</em>, <em class="emphasis">everyone</em>, <em class="emphasis">many</em>, <em class="emphasis">no one</em>, and <em class="emphasis">something</em>, refer to unspecified people or objects. Most indefinite pronouns are singular.</li>
                        <li>A collective noun is a noun that identifies more than one person, place, or thing and treats those people, places, or things one singular unit. Collective nouns require singular verbs.</li>
                        <li>In sentences that begin with <em class="emphasis">here</em> and <em class="emphasis">there</em>, the subject follows the verb.</li>
                        <li>In questions, the subject follows the verb.</li>
